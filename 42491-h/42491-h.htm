<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="l4" />

<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Guten</span> Morgen, Wilhelm!&rdquo; said I, as I entered
the chamber of my fellow student. &ldquo;How
are you this morning? You look better&mdash;your
eyes are brighter, and your cheek possesses
more colour than usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am better, mein Freund,&rdquo; observed the
youth, raising himself up from the bed till his
back rested upon the pillows. &ldquo;But what have
you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fresh supply of flowers for you, Wilhelm,&rdquo;
I replied; &ldquo;and I bought them of the prettiest
Mädchen I ever saw in the market place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ich danke Ihnen für das Geschenk,&rdquo; murmured
the grateful student. &ldquo;You know I love
flowers better than any thing upon earth. They
always fill me with ideas of beauty and purity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and splendour, above all other earthly things;
and I love them because they are so impartial
in bestowing their favours: they confer their
fragrance and their loveliness with equal liberality
on all who venture within their influence.
Put them in the vase, mein freund, and let me
again thank you for so welcome a gift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now let us converse, Wilhelm, if you
feel strong enough;&rdquo; I exclaimed, as I took a
seat by the bedside of the invalid. &ldquo;Has the
physician been this morning? And what said
he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He preceded you but a few minutes, mein
freund,&rdquo; replied Wilhelm, &ldquo;and he said nothing.
He shook his head, however, when he
looked at me, which I considered a bad sign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it, be assured,&rdquo; said I,
earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the head, or in the sign?&rdquo; inquired
my fellow student, with a look of mock gravity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In both,&rdquo; cried I, laughing; &ldquo;in both,
no doubt. But I am glad to see you so cheerful.
Your appearance this morning makes me entertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
hopes of your speedy recovery, and I can
almost convince myself, that in a few days we
shall be together pursuing our studies and our
ramblings, as we have so often and so happily
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been entertaining a similar idea,
mein freund,&rdquo; observed Wilhelm; &ldquo;I feel more
cheerful than I have felt for a long time past;
and I was beginning to flatter myself into a
belief, that the insidious disease was about
evacuating its territory. I shall roam among
the walls of old Göttingen again. I shall associate
with my ancient comrades&mdash;shall I
not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished
by others as well as myself,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but how
liked you the book I lent you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a brilliant production,&rdquo; replied my
friend; &ldquo;and of that class of works which
affords me most pleasure. &lsquo;Give me the enjoyment
of perusing a succession of new works
from the graceful pen of Crébillon, and I shall
have no other want,&rsquo; said Gray. I exclaim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
&lsquo;Give me the gratification of reading the finest
productions in the imaginative literature of every
civilised nation, and there will be little left for
me to wish for.&rsquo; Nothing elevates and delights
me so much as the best of these works, especially
if they be tinged with a tone of high
romantic feeling. What can be so charming as
this mingling of the ideal and the natural?
What can take a firmer hold of the mind and
of the heart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They certainly do, when ably written,
create very powerful impressions;&rdquo; I observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read a considerable portion of the
imaginative literature of almost every European
nation,&rdquo; said Wilhelm; &ldquo;and an extraordinary
power of genius it evinces. The prose fictions
of the present age produced in Germany and
England are wonderfully excellent and abundant.
I think the English exceed all others in
the combination of judgment with imagination,
as seen in the best efforts of Scott, Bulwer, and
Godwin. After them come the Germans, and
we can proudly boast of Göthe, Lafontaine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
Novalis, and Hoffmann. The French have much
imagination and very little judgment, as exhibited
in the writings of Victor Hugo, Mérimée,
Paul de Kock, and Balzac, and are
usually distinguished by their sins against good
taste. Of Italian imaginative literature, the
works I have met with that rise above mediocrity,
are, &lsquo;I Promessi Sposi,&rsquo; of Manzoni,
&lsquo;Ettore Fieramosca,&rsquo; of Massino D&rsquo;Azeglio,
and &lsquo;Franco Allegri,&rsquo; which do not soar very
high. Of the modern fictions of Spain, Portugal,
and Holland, I know nothing; nor do I
believe that there is any thing to know; but I
have seen one or two romantic novels from
Russia that possess considerable merit. What
I object to in works of this nature, written at
the present time, is the too apparent satisfaction
of their authors in remaining in the beaten
track. A vast majority fill their volumes with
characters that have been a thousand times repeated,
and with incidents and situations that
are familiar to every reader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you have them do?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have them strike out a bolder class
of subjects,&rdquo; replied the student. &ldquo;Instead of
being satisfied with attempting illustrations of
historical periods, or of an existing state of
society, suppose they attempt to describe an
imaginary time as well as imaginary characters.
If a man possess a powerful imagination, let
him conceive the state of the world a thousand
years hence, or at any other time remote from
the present. I do not mean that he should
merely delineate a state of society, or of any
section of society; I mean that he should take
the most important portions of the civilised
world, and picture, as well as he is able, the
changes they may undergo, and the state of
their peoples, governments, religions, and philosophy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that such a work would be considered
too serious for the novel reader;&rdquo; I
observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible, mein freund!&rdquo; replied the
student. &ldquo;Always, in works of imagination, the
ideal and the matter of fact should be so
blended as to make an interesting and amusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
whole; and it matters not whether the time
sought to be illustrated be of the past, of the
present, or of the future: each may be made
equally laughable, equally pathetic, and equally
philosophical.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the idea is too comprehensive to be
done well;&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;To draw an imaginary
state of the world in any thing like consonance
with probability, requires more than ordinary
talent in the draughtsman; but to add to it
pictures of an imaginary state of its inhabitants,
and an imaginary state of their philosophy,
presents difficulties which I should think are
not to be overcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The imagination can conquer any difficulty;&rdquo;
exclaimed my companion. &ldquo;There is
no power beneath heaven like imagination.
It can dive into the uttermost corners of the
ocean, or ascend through the trackless fields of
air. It can fly where the eagle dare not move
its wing, and amid Alpine obstacles outclimb
the chamois. It can pass the great desert at a
bound, and bear the four corners of the world
in the hollow of its eye. It seeth all things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
that nature showeth; and after disclosing these,
can show many things that nature never beheld.
It pierces into the most hidden things. It
flingeth a shining light into the most utter
darkness. Locks, bolts, or bars, cannot keep it
out&mdash;laws, walls and chains cannot keep it in:
it is the only thing belonging to human life
that is perfectly free. There is nothing imagination
cannot do; no matter whether it be good
or evil, reasonable or absurd, to it all things
are alike easy. And as for wealth or power
or dignity, or aught of which the world thinks
highly, where is the greatness, and where are
the riches that exceed those of the imagination?
Mechanics are proud of their engines, and think
them wonderful: they are mere playthings compared
with the imagination. Cannot imagination
make the sea dry land, and the earth
ocean? Archimedes boasted that he would
move the world, could he place it in a convenient
situation. Let imagination put forth its
powers, and the world becomes obedient to its
law, moves when required, crumbles into dust,
and is re-created with increased glory. Cannot it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
break the rock like a reed, and snap the gnarled
oak of many centuries like a rotten thread? Cannot
it build cities on the plain, and form a garden
in the wilderness? Cannot it people the solitude
and confer happiness on the desolate?
Cannot it make the sands of the sea-shore
glittering with gold; and of the leaves of the
forest create treasures far outvaluing the riches
of the earth and sea? And more than this, it
can make the dead live and the living die; it
can raise the earthquake and the pestilence;
it can fight battles and win kingdoms; it can
float upon the whirlwind like a leaf upon the
breeze; and pass through a consuming fire
unscathed by a single flame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the powers of the imagination;
and what are its pleasures? Let the most
luxurious seeker after enjoyment take all the
delights reality will give him. Let him wrap
himself up in roses; lie in baths of milk; taste
all that is delicious to the appetite; be loved
by the most lovely and the most loving of
women; and pass not a minute in which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
soul is not lapped in ecstacy; and his enjoyments
will bear no comparison with those of the
imagination. Imagination can concentrate in a
single moment the pleasures of a thousand
years: it possesses all the delights the world
may produce, in addition to raptures more exquisite
of worlds of its own: it can create forms
clothed with a beauty far excelling the rarest
of those who have glorified the earth with
their presence; its sunshine pales the light of
heaven; its flowers alone can bloom with a perpetual
fragrance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilhelm, you must not excite yourself so;&rdquo;
said I, observing him fall back exhausted
against the pillow, from which he had raised
himself, and a violent fit of coughing follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O du ewige Güte?&rdquo; exclaimed the student,
gasping for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I was afraid of this; you are too
weak to allow yourself to be carried away by
the impetuosity of your feelings. Here! take
some of this drink. It will allay the irritation
of the cough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am better now&mdash;I am better, mein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
freund,&rdquo; murmured the grateful Wilhelm; &ldquo;and
now let us resume our conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am almost afraid, Wilhelm, for I see it
excites you so much;&rdquo; I observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has passed away. It is nothing:&rdquo; replied
my companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supposing then, that the idea you mentioned
was attempted to be worked out to its
full extent, how is it possible to convey any thing
like a natural picture of the state of existing
nations at so remote a time?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By a reference to what is already known
of the growth, maturity and decay of nations,&rdquo;
said the student. &ldquo;Every thing has its age.
The tree cannot flourish beyond a certain time&mdash;nor
can a country. Time passes his scythe
over the verdant world, and wherever it glides,
the crop is cut down; and after the field has
been left wild a sufficient period, the seed is
again sown, the produce is again abundant,
and the mower is again at work. Thus it has
been from the creation of the world; thus it will
be for everlasting. How long was the growth
of Babylon, of Nineveh, of Tyre and Sidon, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Thebes and Carthage? They had their season.
Then came Pompeii, Etruria, Athens, Rome,
and Constantinople. How long did they last?
Then came Venice and Genoa, the Moorish
kingdom of Grenada, and the Arabian empire
at Jerusalem; they had their day. After these
came the omnipotence of Popish Rome, the
magnificence of Madrid, and the splendour of
Lisbon: they have departed. And now we
have the glories of London and Paris, and
Berlin and Vienna, and these will exist their
period, and then gradually fall into decay. It
must be evident to any observer, that Spain and
Portugal, once the two greatest nations in Europe,
in opulence, power, and intelligence, are
descending to the lowest degradation of poverty,
insignificance, and ignorance. The Roman empire
in Italy, having passed into a number of
independent states, each of which has attained
a considerable degree of greatness, lies now
prostrate at the foot of the great European
powers. Greece, the intellectual and the free,
having for many centuries been plunged in ignorance
and slavery up to the lips, shews signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
of a regeneration. And the barbarians of the
North are making rapid approaches towards
pre-eminence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the superior civilisation we enjoy, must
prevent our retrograding,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Think of
our steam-engines, our rail-roads, our wonderful
discoveries in science and mechanics,
and our extraordinary advancement in intelligence;
we are rising, and we shall continue to
rise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot rise above the top, mein freund,&rdquo;
observed my fellow student with a smile; &ldquo;and
after that we must go down. There is a point
beyond which no nation advances, and to that
point we are tending. As for our superior civilisation,
that remains to be proved. Boast as
we may of our machinery, we could neither raise
such monuments as were frequent among the
Egyptians, or have we any tools that can make
an impression upon the stone out of which they
were sculptured. The gunpowder upon the discovery
of which we pride ourselves, has not been
so destructive as the Greek fire, of the composition
of which we know nothing. In art, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
are far from excelling the ancients, and in learning
we are obliged to acknowledge our obligations
to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how far the intelligence of the multitude
at the present day exceeds that of any
preceding time!&rdquo; I observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not convinced of that,&rdquo; replied Wilhelm.
&ldquo;With the exception of Germany, particularly
Prussia, the education of the people,
has not been attempted on a plan likely to confer
on them much advantage, and the only sure
way of judging of a superiority of intelligence is
by comparing the state of the public morals in
different countries. If it can be proved that the
Greeks or the Romans were a less moral people
than are the English or the French, then are the
latter the most intellectual; but if, taking the
amount of population, it could be ascertained
that a less amount of crime was committed by
the ancients, then must the moderns be considered
the least civilised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid the philosophical character of
such a work would not be appreciated by the
general reader, who takes up a book merely for
amusement,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, mein freund,&rdquo; replied
the student; &ldquo;there is nothing which may be
made so amusing as philosophy. Every good
book is philosophical; and the idle reader is continually
being made familiar with philosophy
without knowing it, just as the worthy gentleman
in Molière&rsquo;s comedy talked prose all his
life, in perfect ignorance of having done so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I can only say, I should like exceedingly
to read such a book,&rdquo; I observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see that ebony chest there, upon that
pile of books;&rdquo; said Wilhelm, pointing in the
direction to which he had alluded. &ldquo;Take it.
In it you will find a MS. It is a work such as
I have described to you, and I wrote it at intervals,
whenever I could find time for the employment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> write such a work, Wilhelm!&rdquo; exclaimed
I with surprise. &ldquo;I am aware how
much you have devoted yourself to study. I
know that you have completely ruined your
health by your severe application in the pursuit
of knowledge; but I had no conception of
your attempting a production of such a character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
upon a subject beset by so many difficulties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been ambitious,&rdquo; replied my companion.
&ldquo;I was desirous of attempting something
out of the common path&mdash;I yearned for
literary distinction. Take and read it, mein
freund, and let me know if you think it worthy
of publication. I have endeavoured to make the
story full of a deep and pleasing interest. The
characters introduced I have sought to create
in a sufficient variety, and of various shades,
from the humblest in intelligence to the most
exalted. The incidents I have strived to make
striking and powerful, and vividly drawn; and
the opinions you will there find expressed, while
I wished to make them natural and true, I have
been anxious that they should possess a claim to
originality. It has been my aim to combine
wit, humour, pathos, and philosophy in such a
manner as I hope cannot fail of being thought
at once amusing and instructive, and if I live to
see realised the aspirations I have entertained, if
I can but behold the work I have laboured to
produce, in popular estimation, I do not care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
how soon this feeble frame dissolves into its
parent dust. I must live to see that! mein
freund; I <em>must</em> live to see that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not a doubt but what you will, Wilhelm;&rdquo;
I replied. &ldquo;The genius I know you
to possess has only to exhibit itself fairly before
the public, to be considered a public property,
and become an object of general estimation. The
learning you have laboured so diligently to
obtain, will then stand you in good service;
and the liberality of your sentiments, your deep
love of virtuous principle, and your earnest desire
for the diffusion of truth, then cannot
long remain without exciting the admiration
you covet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;There are Gerhard
Kramer, and Hugo Messingen, smoking their
meerschaums out of the opposite window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you asleep, Wilhelm?&rdquo; said I, advancing
from the window to the bedside, and gazing
in the face of my now silent companion. His
head was sunk in the pillow, with his light hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
falling in waving curls around it. There lay
the calm blue eyes, the fair smooth cheek, the
delicate moustache, and the mouth so exquisitely
small, half open, giving a glimpse of the
white teeth within it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you asleep, Wilhelm?&rdquo; I repeated,
taking the hand that rested outside the bed
clothes.</p>

<p>He <em>was</em> asleep: and from that sleep he never
awoke. He now lies in the left hand corner of
Göttingen churchyard&mdash;a familiar place to me;
for while he was the most studious, he was
the most amiable of all my fellow students. He
had become a martyr to his love of study, and
the world closed upon him just as he exhibited
those signs of extraordinary merit, which in
time would have made him one of its most distinguished
ornaments. That his death was
quite unexpected by himself was evident, but in
the progress of his illness he had drawn up a
will, in which he had made me his executor, and
in it expressed his desire that I should prepare
his manuscript for the press. I have done so,
and the result is before the reader. I have left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
the first chapter as I found it, giving notes to
illustrate a few phrases that required explanation;
but imagining that these phrases, though
perfectly characteristic, might perplex the
reader in his progress with the story, I made such
alterations in the rest of the MS. as I thought
would bring the work nearer to the taste of the
time.</p>

<span class="f8">THE CITY OF THE WORLD.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">More</span> than usual activity was observable in
the tiers of shipping of various nations that
crowded the port of Columbus. The sun
shone with extraordinary splendour, throwing
a golden light over the broad waters of the
river that spread out as far as the eye could
reach, bearing on their bosom vessels of every
description used in commerce or warfare (some
coming into port, others leaving it for a distant
destination), that were diminishing in size as
they receded from the view, till they assumed
the appearance of a mere speck between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
horizon and the wave; and the spreading sails
of those in the distance, and the many-coloured
flags streaming from the masts of those closer
to the shore, with their various builds, sizes,
costume and characteristics of their crews, and
the variety of employments in which the latter
were engaged,&mdash;infused such a spirit of animation
into the scene, that the stranger would
have found it impossible to have looked on
without an earnest and delighted attention.
Nearer the shore boats were passing to and
fro&mdash;from the graceful Swan <a name="NoteAnchor_1" id="NoteAnchor_1"></a><a href="#Note_1" class="nodec">(1.)</a> and rapid
Fish, full of gay parties of pleasure, to the
gigantic Hippopotamus and slow Tortoise, bearing
burthens of various kinds of produce towards
the wharfs that lined each side of that noble
river; and many other boats of different dimensions,
some impelled by oars, others by sails,
and others by machinery, were passing from
ship to ship, from the ship to the shore, or from
the metropolis to the neighbouring villages.</p>

<p>If the appearances on the water were gratifying
to the eye, those on the land assumed a
character equally cheerful, various, and magnificent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Well might Columbus be styled <strong>The
City of the World</strong>. In its dimensions, in
its splendour, in its riches, in the myriads of
its inhabitants, and in the multitudes of
strangers who flocked from all parts of the
globe to witness its greatness or share in its
traffic, it was worthy of being considered an
empire rather than a metropolis. Beyond
those unrivalled quays that stretched along each
side of the river, connected by colossal bridges,
whose arches spanned from shore to shore with
such an altitude that under them the largest
vessels might pass with ease, were seen the
proud palaces of the merchants&mdash;the lofty
domes for the administration of justice&mdash;the
stupendous edifices for the conveniences of
commerce&mdash;the vast temples for the worship
of the Deity&mdash;the imposing halls for the
diffusion of science&mdash;every description of
dwelling suitable to the wants of a free, industrious,
enlightened, and multitudinous population
of various ranks, interspersed with noble
monuments in commemoration of admirable
actions&mdash;exalted statues personifying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
highest degree of excellence&mdash;parks, fountains,
gardens, and public walks between rows of
lofty trees; rising above these, on the elevated
land on which the city was erected, might be
observed, placed at considerable distances from
each other, and adorned with all the graces of
architecture, the villas of the wealthy; and at
the very crown of the hill the obelisks, urns,
and other monuments that peered above its
summit pointed out the cemetery of the city, and
the mausolea of its dead.</p>

<p>Through the numerous streets the tide of
population seemed hurrying with an anxious
eagerness; and the vehicles of luxury and of
industry were passing each other in the broad
thoroughfares, in a similar crowd and with a
similar haste. Here came the votary of pleasure,
seeking only the enjoyment of the present&mdash;there
went the accumulator of wealth,
enjoying no delight save in the prospect of the
future; and they were passed by the plodding
antiquary, living only in his associations with
the past. The toil-worn mechanic&mdash;the
enthusiastic student&mdash;the venerable sage&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
solemn priest&mdash;the proud soldier&mdash;and the
bustling citizen, took their separate ways
through the crowd, with an apparent thoughtlessness
of all things except their own immediate
objects; and thus had they gone on for
ages, each pursuing his own course, and every
one heedless of the rest; and thus will they go
on till the day of the world is over, and the
night cometh when no man shall see because
of the darkness.</p>

<p>At the foot of a flight of broad stone steps
leading to the water from a wharf on the quay
near one of the bridges, a superior sort of ship&rsquo;s
boat was moored, where her crew, some resting
on the benches, some lounging on the steps,
were grouped in conversation, evidently directing
their attention to a beautiful ship of small tonnage
but perfect symmetry that lay at anchor
at a short distance, easily distinguished from the
numerous vessels in her neighbourhood by the
smartness of her rigging and the elegance of
her build.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Boggle!&rdquo; exclaimed a stout
weatherbeaten-looking mariner, to whom all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
his associates appeared to listen with great
deference, arising either from his superior age
or station,&mdash;&ldquo;she <em>is</em> a smart boat; as neat a one
as ever floated. She&rsquo;ll swim better than a shark,
and faster than a dolphin; and I&rsquo;ll wager a
month&rsquo;s pay to a mouldy biscuit, that between
this and the tother side o&rsquo; the world we shan&rsquo;t
meet with her match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True enough, Hearty,&rdquo; said the person
spoken to, a lumbering, stout, short, and awkwardly-made
man of about thirty, with a large
head, and a stupid yet good-natured countenance,
which expressed an inclination to act
in the right way that was always marred by an
extraordinary aptitude to do wrong. &ldquo;True
enough. May I walk the deck till I split into
shivers, if I&rsquo;m not convinced of every word you
say! But every man as is a man and thinks
like a man should have a notion of his own on
things in general; therefore, Hearty, I don&rsquo;t
believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; exclaimed a younger sailor, addressing
himself to the last speaker, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
value o&rsquo; your judgment against the notions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
such an old hand as Hearty? Why he must
ha&rsquo; sailed in a power o&rsquo; different crafts afore you
were launched!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Climberkin, exactly,&rdquo; replied
Boggle eagerly&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s my opinion; it&rsquo;s true,
there&rsquo;s not a doubt of it: but every man as is
a man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, may I be scrunched into everlasting
smash if I know where we&rsquo;re bound&mdash;that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
emphatically remarked another speaker in the
group, thrusting forward a thick head of sandy
hair, with a countenance sharp and meagre.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; echoed several around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you see how it is,&rdquo; answered Boggle,
mysteriously; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a sort o&rsquo; a secret in it.
It arn&rsquo;t for a fellow afore the mast to be &rsquo;quisitive
o&rsquo; what&rsquo;s going on on the quarter-deck;
but I likes to have right notions o&rsquo; things in
general, as every man as is a man and thinks
like a man should. So having a pretty shrewd
guess as how Scrumpydike, who&rsquo;s al&rsquo;ays alongside
the captain, knowed more o&rsquo; the matter than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
he&rsquo;d a mind to &rsquo;municate, I follows in his wake
not a hundred years longer than this very
mornin&rsquo;; and, quite palavering like, I hails him
wi&rsquo; &lsquo;I say, Scrumpydike, my bo!&rsquo; &lsquo;What
cheer?&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;P&rsquo;raps you don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; our sailing orders?&rsquo; says I, quite social.
&lsquo;P&rsquo;raps I do,&rsquo; says he, in a manner as showed
he did. I says nothin&rsquo; more on <em>that</em> subject then,
cause I had a notion &rsquo;twould be no good; so I
speaks him civil, and axed him to liquidate
wi&rsquo; me upon summat comfortable, and we went
together into a snuggish sort o&rsquo; a spiritual close
by, and when I got him pretty &rsquo;municative I
thought he&rsquo;d a told the most secret thing as he
knowed, cause he was letting down the cable in
reg&rsquo;lar style. Now&rsquo;s the time, thought I; so I says
to him, quite familiar, as I felt sartain sure o&rsquo; his
telling, &lsquo;Scrumpydike, my bo!&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;where
be we bound?&rsquo;&mdash;And what d&rsquo;ye think he said?&rdquo;
inquired the speaker, suddenly addressing himself
to his associates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>did</em> he say, Boggle?&rdquo; anxiously
inquired a young sailor, pressing forward to
hear the interesting communication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us, Boggle, tell us!&rdquo; cried the others
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why he turns round upon me his great
yellow eyes, looking as if he could ha&rsquo; no
secrets from a fellow who shared his earnings
so handsome&mdash;&rsquo;cause I stood treat all the time,
and he says to me, in a slow whisper, just as a
secret should be told&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did he say?&rdquo; said Climberkin
impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the odds?&rsquo;, says he.&rdquo;&mdash;The younger
sailors laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what <em>is</em> the odds?&rdquo; asked old Hearty
earnestly. &ldquo;Arn&rsquo;t we well paid, well fed,
well clothed? and haven&rsquo;t we plenty o&rsquo; every
thing we want? So what&rsquo;s the odds where we
sail? I don&rsquo;t care the twist o&rsquo; a rope&rsquo;s end
whether we go to India, or China, or Algiers,
to any of the ports in Australia, or even to
the most uncivilized settlements in Europe; and
no true sailor cares on what water he floats, as
long as he&rsquo;s aboard a good ship, meets wi&rsquo;
sociable mates, and is commanded by good
officers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be spiflicated if every word Hearty says
isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; remarked Climberkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ll just tell you what I knows
o&rsquo; the matter,&rdquo; continued Hearty, &ldquo;which
amounts to something more than Boggle could
tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; inquired Boggle, as
eager as the others to hear some intelligence
on the subject,&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re smartish, clever, or
I&rsquo;m &rsquo;staken; but though I must say my notion
o&rsquo; you is tip top, we&rsquo;re most on us liable to a
false reck&rsquo;ning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You all know master Porphyry,&rdquo; said the
old man, without attending to the dubious
compliment of the last speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know him! to be sure we do,&rdquo; replied
Climberkin hastily. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we all sailed in
his ships,&mdash;all but Scrumpydike there, who&rsquo;s
asleep in the boat? and don&rsquo;t we know as he&rsquo;s
the richest merchant in Columbia, and got ships
laden with every sort o&rsquo; precious merchandise,
more than one man ever had afore&mdash;sailing
from port to port all over every sea that
runs. Know him! Why, who do we know, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
we don&rsquo;t know a man as all the world
knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; remarked the other quietly,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s him; they do say he&rsquo;s as rich as the
emperor. But all I know is, that while he&rsquo;s
greatest among the rich he&rsquo;s kindest among the
poor. He seems never happy but when he&rsquo;s
founding some hospital,&mdash;setting afoot some
charity, or doing some good, some how or
other: his name is honoured in all parts o&rsquo; the
world. There&rsquo;s no merchant all over this here
globe that hasn&rsquo;t heard of the fame of master
Porphyry: and in his own country he&rsquo;s like a
prince, scattering his bounties wherever he
thinks they are likely to confer a benefit; and
every one respects him, every one wishes to
think as he does; and all are anxious to show
their opinion of his integrity, cleverness, and
all that sort o&rsquo; thing. Well, what&rsquo;s uncommon
strange, although he squanders his money about
as if there was no end to it, it seems only to
&rsquo;cumulate the faster; and although the emperor
has signified his wish to honour him wi&rsquo; lots o&rsquo;
distinctions many&rsquo;s the great man would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
proud enough to gain, he refuses them all, and
says he won&rsquo;t be nothing more nor plain master
Porphyry. So master Porphyry he remains;
but for all that he&rsquo;s a greater man than all the
princes, dukes, and nobles we&rsquo;re likely to see
in our time. Well, master Porphyry&rsquo;s got a
son, as smart a figure of a youth as ever
you see&rsquo;d aboard ship; and after &rsquo;ducating
him in all sorts o&rsquo; learnin&rsquo;, till he&rsquo;s fit to be
launched in the great ocean o&rsquo; life, he wishes
him, nat&rsquo;rul enough, to go and see foreign parts,
that he may get plenty o&rsquo; notions o&rsquo; different
kinds o&rsquo; people, and countries, and governments,
that when he comes back he may be able to do
credit to his father. So master Porphyry gets
a ship built o&rsquo; purpose, and a lovelier vessel
than the Albatross it arn&rsquo;t possible to look on;
and has her stored wi&rsquo; every kind o&rsquo; valuable
merchandise likely to sell to a profit at the
ports she may visit, and wi&rsquo; all sorts o&rsquo; necessaries
and comforts for the crew; has her manned
wi&rsquo; a prime set o&rsquo; picked hands from his other
vessels,&mdash;engages a &rsquo;sperienced captain, and
accompanied by the most celebrated teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
o&rsquo; learnin&rsquo; he could meet with, to show all the
&rsquo;markable things as might be overhauled, and
give the proper &rsquo;splanations about their breed,
seed, and generation, I expects him here every
minute to go aboard; and &rsquo;mediately arter that,
up wi&rsquo; her cleaver, out wi&rsquo; her wings, and good
bye to old Columbia.&rdquo; <a name="NoteAnchor_2" id="NoteAnchor_2"></a><a href="#Note_2" class="nodec">(2.)</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let me twist the rope a little,&rdquo; <a name="NoteAnchor_3" id="NoteAnchor_3"></a><a href="#Note_3" class="nodec">(3.)</a> said
Climberkin, while his messmates continued to
listen with the same interest they had shown
all the time Hearty had been speaking. &ldquo;You
see, mates,&rdquo; continued the young sailor, apparently
attempting to make the sleeves of his
check shirt roll above his elbows with more
convenience, but more probably trying to
attract attention from the heightening colour
of his cheek,&mdash;&ldquo;you see, mates, I&rsquo;ve been sailing
in convoy with a mighty smartish craft, who&rsquo;s
a sort o&rsquo; cook&rsquo;s mate,&mdash;(now what are you
jiggering at?&rdquo; cried the speaker sharply to a
young fellow who had indulged himself with a
grin,)&mdash;&ldquo;who&rsquo;s a sort of cook&rsquo;s mate in the
noble family of Philadelphia; and she being
always among her messmates, hears a smartish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
lot o&rsquo; notions &rsquo;cerning her officers, which, when
we&rsquo;ve been yard-arm and yard-arm sailing in
company through the parks, or at anchor in the
jollity houses, she &rsquo;municates to me by way o&rsquo;
divarsion: and she tells me as how master
Porphyry has a snuggery up the country, &rsquo;bout
a cable&rsquo;s length from one belonging to the
noble Philadelphia, and that the two families
were as sociable as a shoal o&rsquo; herrins. Philadelphia
has a daughter, by all accounts a reg&rsquo;lar-built
angelic; and master Porphyry having a
son, an equally smartish sort o&rsquo; young chap,
it was as sartain as a ship would sail afore the
wind, that they two while consortin&rsquo; would pick
up some notions about gettin&rsquo; afloat together;
and as no signals o&rsquo; a diff&rsquo;rent natur&rsquo; were hung
out by their commodores, they linked their
hearts pretty close, and never could see which
way the wind blowed &rsquo;cept when they were
alongside o&rsquo; each other. Well, somehow or
other, there came on a squall,&mdash;the powerful
noble Philadelphia and the rich merchant Porphyry
parted company about politics: one
took one side and t&rsquo;other took t&rsquo;other, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
went on different tacks in no time. Philadelphia,
who&rsquo;s as proud as a port admiral,
when he found as master Porphyry wouldn&rsquo;t
follow in his wake, blowed great guns, cut his
cable; and without letting his daughter the
Lady Eureka have any &rsquo;munication with her
consort, he makes her set sail along wi&rsquo; him,
and the young ones arn&rsquo;t been allowed to come
in sight o&rsquo; each other ever since. Well, arter
that, master Porphyry, who&rsquo;s as proud as an
honest man should be, wern&rsquo;t a going to strike
his flag to nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the sort; so seeing as his
young&rsquo;un looked cloudy weather, to &rsquo;leviate his
disappointment he thinks o&rsquo; trying to make him
forget the whole circumbendibus. So he plans
this here voyage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The loud huzzas of an approaching multitude
put an end to the conversation; and Scrumpydike,
who appeared to have been asleep, but
had listened attentively to every word that had
been uttered, suddenly started from his recumbent
position in the boat, presenting a muscular
form, with a yellow, rough, and scowling face,
sufficiently forbidding in its appearance, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
possessing an odd sort of twist about the
corners of the mouth that much disguised its
natural ferocity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thunder and lightning!&rdquo; <a name="NoteAnchor_4" id="NoteAnchor_4"></a><a href="#Note_4" class="nodec">(4.)</a> shouted
Scrumpydike, hastily regaining his legs, &ldquo;here
they come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the sailors ran up the stone steps
leading to the foot of the bridge, and there a
noble and gratifying sight presented itself. The
whole length of the magnificent street of stately
mansions approaching the water seemed filled
with a countless multitude of citizens, each
huzzaing with extraordinary zeal some persons
in a procession that was proceeding along the
centre of the thoroughfare. Windows, housetops,
bridges, and boats were thronged with
spectators; and all the vessels in the river were
dressed with flags, which, streaming from the
masts in a variety of pleasing colours and devices,
gave an animated and picturesque character to
the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>There&rsquo;s</em> master Porphyry!&rdquo; exclaimed
Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; inquired half a dozen voices at
once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That stately-looking man on the tall grey
horse who is bowing to his fellow-citizens.
Every body seems to have got a notion that the
merchant&rsquo;s son was going on his first voyage; so,
you see, they&rsquo;re resolved to show how much
they respect the father, and all the city turns
out to a man (aye and to a woman too, as you
may see at the windows), and here they are
throwing up their caps, waving their handkerchiefs,
and shouting like mad; the ladies scattering
flowers upon his head, and bands o&rsquo; music
playing all the way. And there&rsquo;s young master
Porphyry riding by his side, a fine handsome
sort o&rsquo; chap, and as like his father as one whale&rsquo;s
like another. And in the open carriage behind
them is the learned Professor Fortyfolios, who&rsquo;s
written more big books than any on us could
carry; and opposite him&rsquo;s our Captain Compass,
and next him&rsquo;s little Log, the captain&rsquo;s clerk;
and opposite him&rsquo;s Doctor Tourniquet, our surgeon;
and there&rsquo;s a lot more on &rsquo;em followin&rsquo; in
different carriages, who ha&rsquo; been promoted to a
birth aboard the Albatross. These dignified
bodies in long robes, and some on &rsquo;em wi&rsquo; gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
chains round their necks, are great magistrates
and merchants belonging to the city, and they
look up to master Porphyry as head on &rsquo;em all.
But we must get to our oars, my mates, or else
we shall nap it pretty considerably.&rdquo; So saying
he returned to the boat, quickly followed by
his companions, and they all began to be very
busy preparing for the comers.</p>

<p>The appearance of the procession as it neared
the bridge was very imposing; for, as far as the
eye could see, were carriages and horsemen
bearing streaming banners, and decorated with
ribbons and flowers; and every spot that could
command a view of the scene from the land or
from the water was crowded with animated
spectators, shouting their good wishes for the
son and praises of the father. The chief attraction
in this grand spectacle, master Porphyry,
was a man apparently between forty and fifty
years of age, of a commanding figure and noble
countenance. When he took off a sort of coronetted
velvet cap that shielded his head from
the sun&rsquo;s rays, as he bowed his grateful acknowledgments
for the plaudits of his fellow-citizens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
his high forehead, eloquent eyes, and benevolent
smile made his features assume an expression
more nearly approaching the highest degree of
beauty, intelligence, and philanthropy in a man
advanced in life, than anything it is possible to
conceive; and the robe of honour which encompassed
his powerful limbs, denoting his office
as the chief civic magistrate, gave a majesty to
his deportment that increased the effect of his
personal appearance.</p>

<p>The youth who rode by his side could not
have numbered much more than twenty years,
and bore a great resemblance both in the form
of his limbs and in the expression of his countenance
to master Porphyry; yet while from a
feeling of enthusiastic reverence for his parent
he rode bare-headed by his side, as he noticed
the admiration his father excited among the
countless myriads who thronged their way, the
fire that was glowing in his eyes and the pride
that was swelling at his heart gave evidence of
feelings to which the elder Porphyry was a
stranger. The youth sat on his steed, that
pranced and curvetted with the same high spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in his blood as was possessed by his rider, showing
that elasticity of limb that marks the young
and vigorous; and as the breeze swept from his
forehead the luxuriant curls of rich shining hair
that clustered upon his brows, while it fluttered
in the folds of his handsome tunic, the young
men whose dreams had been of glory fancied
that they saw in his noble bearing the hero of
their visions, and the young women who had
begun feeding their youthful minds with loving
idealities gazed in ecstasy upon his graceful
figure, and recognised in him the god of their
idolatry. The impression created was evidently
gratifying to him; but it did not satisfy his
desires. Oriel Porphyry was ambitious&mdash;he
aspired to be something greater than he was:
he panted for power as well as popularity. The
shouts of the multitude seemed music to his ears,
but it was of too calm a character&mdash;it was not
that in which he could have taken most delight.
He desired to act a more imposing part than
that of a merchant&rsquo;s son. It was a military age
in which he lived, when men had been raised to
empire by a daring valour and a dazzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
splendour in their actions that made every heart
drunk with enthusiasm. Conquest had been the
key to greatness, and a victory had led to a throne.
But the general peace which had lately commenced
seemed to shut out from him all hopes
of the distinction he coveted; the peaceful ways
of traffic, in which his father had achieved an
universal renown, presented to him no attraction:
and as he rode along he lamented the apparent
ingloriousness of his destiny.</p>

<p>The feelings of the merchant were of a far
higher, better, kinder character; for his was a
mind not to be led away by the false glitter of
pride and ambition, and he entertained no sentiment
that was not in harmony with the philanthropy
of his actions. His heart was full of
generous sympathy for his fellow-men; and till
he alighted at the foot of the bridge he thought
only of how he could best advance the interests
of his country.</p>

<p>The father and son descended the stone
stairs, at the bottom of which the boatmen were
waiting; and after all who were going to the
ship had entered the boat except the merchant&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
son, master Porphyry took him affectionately
by the hand, and thus addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oriel Porphyry! I have desired that you
should visit the most remarkable nations of the
world, that you might gain from close observation
of their people and government knowledge
such as may the better fit you for your duties
as a citizen and as a man; that when I have
passed away from the fading splendours that
surround me, I shall know that I leave one
worthy to fill the high place I have held in the
affections of my fellow-citizens. Take these
papers,&rdquo; continued the merchant, in a voice that
appeared to tremble with emotion, as he produced
a sealed packet&mdash;&ldquo;they contain the
directions I desire you to pursue, and some
intelligence with which I wish you to become
acquainted: consult them when you have been
out at sea about a week. I shall find means of
communicating with you as often as may be
desirable; and if there is any thing you require
that yonder vessel does not possess to render
your voyage more comfortable, you have only
to send word by the first of my ships you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
meet, and you will have it supplied at the next
port. All noble sentiments and benevolent
wishes attend you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; exclaimed the youth, falling on
the neck and kissing the hand of his parent,
&ldquo;I trust I shall never discredit the education I
have received, nor the parent from whom I
sprung.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes master Porphyry was
standing on the brink of the water, surrounded
by the wealthiest merchants of Columbus, following
with his eyes the rapid course of the
receding boat; while his son, throwing himself
back in his seat, indulged in the enjoyment of a
thousand conflicting emotions, from which he
was not roused till he gained the side of the
Albatross.</p>

<p>While the machinery was set in motion to
draw up the anchor, a small boat was seen to
dart from the numerous vessels of a similar
class that were floating on the river, and rapidly
come alongside the ship. A young handsome
creole immediately leapt on board; and after
giving orders about some packages contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
in the boat, advanced to that part of the deck
where Oriel Porphyry stood. The age of the
new-comer did not seem more than fifteen or
sixteen. He was delicately formed, with features
whose expression lost something in its character
among critics of manly beauty by its feminine
softness. On his head he wore a rich netted silk
cap, the gold tassel of which hung down towards
his left shoulder; his robe was a short tunic of
embroidered cloth, bound by a broad silk sash.
An inner vest of rose-coloured silk, open at the
breast, disclosed a camese of the purest white;
the lower part of his body was wrapt in a sort
of petticoat of thick linen made very full, below
which appeared leggings of rich silk, and small
shoes trimmed with rosettes,&mdash;the usual costume
of the pages of Columbian ladies of rank. The
merchant&rsquo;s son was leaning against a mast,
seemingly pondering over the fond remembrances
of a happier time; for his features had
lost that glow of excitement which a few
minutes since his ambitious desires had created,
and a shadow of deep yet tranquil melancholy
had passed over them,&mdash;when he was roused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
from his reverie by the approach of the
stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Oriel Porphyry!&rdquo; said the page,
taking off his cap and allowing a profusion of
dark ringlets to fall upon his shoulders, and then
taking from his vest a small sealed packet,&mdash;&ldquo;Master
Oriel Porphyry! The Lady Eureka
sends you this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed the young merchant,
gazing earnestly upon the features before him
as if they were immediately recognised; then
finding the recognition not reciprocal, he turned
away with a deep expression of disappointment:
yet, while breaking the seal of the envelope, and
before he read the letter, he renewed his gaze
two or three times, as if there was an attraction
in the page&rsquo;s handsome countenance he could
not withstand; but the large dark eyes that
met his own were bent steadily upon him with
respectful attention; and, bewildered by the
strange disturbance of his thoughts, he at last
attempted to read the letter. It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sal">&ldquo;Dearest,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accidentally I have become acquainted with
your intended departure from Columbia, to
dare the dangers of the waters, to risk a
thousand perils, and, more than all, to be
separated by a long and dreary boundary from
a heart you have made so devotedly your own.
Every attempt I have made to communicate
with you, has been rendered of no avail. I
believe you all I would have you be; but I am
fearful your impetuous nature will hurry you
into continual dangers, and, as I cannot myself
watch over your safety, I would have near you
some one on whose zeal, fidelity, and care I can
place the utmost confidence. Zabra, whom you
will readily recognise as a child of my father,
has been brought up as my page; his Indian
mother died in his infancy, but his education
has not been neglected. You will find him both
useful and entertaining, and may rely on his
perfect devotion. Let him remain about you&mdash;let
him be my representative&mdash;and let him
serve to keep in your remembrance one whose
soul clings to your footsteps,&mdash;who has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
ambition but in possessing your exclusive affections,
and knows no pride but that which is
created by thinking herself, <em>your</em></p>

<p class="sgn">
Eureka.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>The letter was read many times, and with an
increasing pleasure at each re-perusal; and the
bearer was received with such an abundance of
welcomes as must have convinced him his servitude
would be very light. But while his
future master kept scanning his dusky physiognomy,
as if comparing his features with the
brilliant beauty of her who had so long been
the glory of his existence, the page retained the
same unmoved demeanour which he had from
the first evinced.</p>

<p>During these proceedings the anchor had
been weighed, the sails trimmed, and, amid the
firing of cannon from the houses on each bank,
and the deafening shouts of the spectators, the
Albatross majestically sailed down the river,
and having reached the ocean, soon lost sight
of the city of Columbus, its noble quays, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
stately palaces, its generous merchant, and its
grateful citizens.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_II" id="CHAP_II">CHAP. II.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">ZABRA.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Zabra</span> had not been many days on board,
before he became a source of wonder to the
whole crew. A spirit flashed from his dark
lustrous eyes, that kept off every thing approaching
the shape of sociality among the
persons by whom he was surrounded. He
rarely spoke, except when attending upon
Oriel Porphyry; and then the proud expression
of his looks that made curiosity stand aloof,
was changed into a glowing animation, and the
tongue which had seemed to disdain all converse
became eloquent with a resistless endeavour to
delight. He had all the external appearance
of a graceful youth of sixteen, with a form tall,
elegant, and buoyant, whose heart had just
received the invigorating warmth of the first
dawn of manly sentiments; but when the voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sent its soft music to the ear, breathing the
rich poetry of an ardent imagination, the
splendour of the language, its power and
meaning, and the energy with which it was
supported, gave evidence of a mind much
nearer approaching the maturity of a masculine
intellect, than the age that has been mentioned
could have possessed. He seemed as if he
existed only for the purpose for which he had
been sent&mdash;as if he knew that his occupation
was watching over the safety of him to whom
he had been committed; and he appeared to
enter into the service with a heart and soul
devoted to the object. His looks searched the
inmost thoughts of those upon whom they fell,
as if to discover whether any sinister intention
against his lord and master was there harboured,
and before their piercing sight it was
scarcely possible to stand unmoved; and there
was a mystery in his actions, when removed
from the apparent source of his solicitude, that
still more made the wonderers marvel. He
sought a place where no one could intrude
upon his privacy, and with a harp, with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
on these occasions he never failed to be accompanied,
so filled the air with unknown melodies,
and unheard-of songs, that the superstitious
seamen, as they listened, imagined he was in
communication with beings of another world,&mdash;there
was something so aërial, so soft, and so
sweet in the music he created.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scrunch me if I can make it out at all!&rdquo;
exclaimed Climberkin to a group of sailors in
the forecastle. &ldquo;He ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got a word to throw
away upon a dog; but if he looks at one, one
doesn&rsquo;t feel at all inclined to be &rsquo;quisitive. He
was wand&rsquo;rin&rsquo; about the main deck as it was
getting duskish yesterday&mdash;and I, not keeping
a good look out ahead, run foul o&rsquo; him afore
I knowed who it was. As soon as I diskivered
the craft, I was just beginning a bit of a &rsquo;pology,
when he fixes on me a look as cut through me
like a nor-wester, waves his arm in a most
mysterus manner, and glides away as softly as
if he trod upon butter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As true as a fish swims, I&rsquo;ve got the only
prime notion of this here mystery,&rdquo; said Boggle,
with an air of considerable importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried several voices incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! but I have though, or I&rsquo;m the spawn
of a toad-fish!&rdquo; replied Boggle. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll
tell you how I gripped it. You see I ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a
bit afeard o&rsquo; any &rsquo;dividual as is aboveboard in
what he&rsquo;s arter; and I&rsquo;m not the chap likely
to be flabbergasted in a fair fight;&mdash;so seeing
as how you were all in no little mystification
about this youngster, I thought to myself, says
I, when he steers his course into your whereabouts,
&rsquo;spose you show a civil flag at the mast-head,
and ax arter his mother and all the
family; he nat&rsquo;rally sees you knows manners,
and &rsquo;mediately returns the compliment. From
this to that, and from that to t&rsquo;other, is as easy
as catching sharks wi&rsquo; pickled pork, when two
civil fellows lets go their jawing tackle; so you&rsquo;ll
tell him your &rsquo;miniscences quite confidential,
and he&rsquo;ll be obligated to tell you his&rsquo;n; and
then having overhauled his log-book pretty
smartish, you can return to your mates with
the &rsquo;telligence. Well, I was walking along jest
afore dinner, when I seed master Zabra leaning
against a mast, wi&rsquo; folded arms, eyes looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
straight up to the clouds as was fleecing over
the sky in all sorts o&rsquo; figurations, and his
mahogany face seemin&rsquo; quite fair by the side
o&rsquo; the rollin&rsquo; jet black curls as fell on each
cheek down to his shoulder. I seed in a
moment he was no common sort o&rsquo; cretur. If
he ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a Indian prince, thinks I, I&rsquo;ve no
notion o&rsquo; things in general. Well, I was determined
to know the rights on&rsquo;t, and was just
about recomembring the bit of a speech I was
going to say about his mother and the rest o&rsquo;
the family, when, as I came right afore him, he
looks me full in the face; and though I seed
nothin&rsquo; but the flash o&rsquo; his two eyes afore he
flitted away to the other end o&rsquo; the ship, they
seemed so &rsquo;stonishingly curious that they held
me to the ground as if I was nailed to the deck,
and the words I was going to say stuck in
my throat like lumps o&rsquo; old Cucumber-Shin&rsquo;s
puddin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kukumshin!&rdquo; shouted the black cook, a
very fat old negro, indignantly thrusting his
woolly poll in the middle of the group. &ldquo;Dare
to call me Kukumshin! Me, Roly Poly Cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in ship Albatross, and free gennleman o&rsquo; colour&mdash;me
Kukumshin! Pretty kettle o&rsquo; fish!&mdash;Puddin&rsquo;
berry much too good for sich a fellar.
Stick in him troat too! Him nebber hab no
time, acause him bolt him like smoke, a fellar!
Call me Kukumshin indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell ye what it is, my mates,&rdquo; cried Hearty,
inattentive to Roly Poly&rsquo;s indignation. The
group were all attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fellar!&rdquo; exclaimed the cook, casting one
of his blackest looks upon the offender, and
then waddling off to another part of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my time I&rsquo;ve been many voyages to India
and thereabouts,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;and I
knows it&rsquo;s the notion o&rsquo; them people, that arter a
fellow&rsquo;s dead he comes to life again in another
sort of a body. Now if this here rigmarole&rsquo;s
true, which every body there says is as sartain
as a stone &rsquo;ill sink, seeing that this youngster is
more &rsquo;cute in his notions than is usual at his
time o&rsquo; day, and appears a most &rsquo;straordinary
sort o&rsquo; a human, it&rsquo;s much more nat&rsquo;ral to &rsquo;spose
he&rsquo;s been metamorphorosed from some of those
Old Indian flos&rsquo;phers who &rsquo;s up to ev&rsquo;ry thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in natur&rsquo;, than that he should be a mere
hobbledehoy, as can&rsquo;t have any more gumption
than what &rsquo;ll serve him to carry a letter or go
on a message. But hush!&rdquo; exclaimed the
speaker as a beautiful symphony full of passionate
sentiment was borne upon the air. A
soft melodious voice soon mingled with the instrument,
and these words were sung with all
the expression superior skill could bestow upon
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! that <em>is</em> music,&rdquo; observed Climberkin
in a whisper; &ldquo;and it makes my heart leap
like a dolphin just taken out o&rsquo; his element.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hands to take in sail!&rdquo; shouted a
stentorian voice from the quarter-deck, and in
an instant the group were engaged in active
duty.</p>

<p>But the song had other listeners than the
party just described. Oriel Porphyry, after
escaping from a weary lecture from the learned
professor Fortyfolios, who seemed laudably
anxious to fulfil his duties to his pupil, had
been pacing the quarter-deck with long and
hasty strides, when he was roused from the
ambitious reveries of his ardent imagination by
the mellow sounds of a harp at no great distance.
In him, the voice, the song, its sentiments, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
their expression, recalled to his memory the
delicious beauty of her, from the wondrous
lustre of whose gaze he had drunk of that intoxicating
stream which had bound his senses
in a wild and rapturous delirium. The dark
eyes, radiant with the light of the impassioned
soul that floated in their depths, again raised on
him their sunny splendour; and the budding
mouth, bearing the odorous spirits of a thousand
roses on its lips, once more appeared to teach
those smiling lessons that had been to him the
fairest pages in the book of knowledge. He
listened, and his heart was filled with the sweet
influence of a happier time. The dreams of
ambition were forgot&mdash;the suggestions of pride
were unthought of&mdash;fame, glory, power,
the pomp of greatness, the sway of empire,
and the adulation of the governed, were now as
things for which he had no sympathy; and he
thought only of the time when the noble, gifted,
young, and beautiful Eureka, regardless of the
loftiness of her exalted station, the opinions of
her princely family, or the sentiments of the
world, ennobled him with the passionate ecstacies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of her enthusiastic nature, and first filled
his youthful brain with those heroic dreams
which made him yearn after the glorious influence
of superiority.</p>

<p>During the continuance of the song he listened
with breathless attention, and the rich
harmonies of the music kept him spell-bound to
the spot on which he stood; but as the last
chords of the closing symphony were struck, he
stood by the side of the musician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew not, Zabra, that you were so
well skilled in the science of sweet sounds,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>Zabra had appeared so lost in his own meditations,
that he had not noticed master Porphyry&rsquo;s
approach. His gaze was fixed; and as he bent
over his harp, allowing the long curls of his dark
hair to mingle with its strings, no attitude, and
no expression of countenance, could more plainly
interpret the perfect state of self-abandonment in
which he then existed; but when he heard the
voice of him by whom he was addressed, in an instant
his dark handsome features assumed a different
expression, and throwing back the shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
tresses that shaded his face, he seemed a creature
all smiles, devotion, and enjoyment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Music has been to me the food of my existence,&rdquo;
remarked the page: &ldquo;on its divine
essence I was nurtured; and as the perfume
forms a part of the breeze on which it is borne,
harmony has entered into my nature, and is now
my life, my strength, and my felicity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you learn the song I have just
heard?&rdquo; inquired the merchant&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the impulses of my own creative
spirit,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;From sympathies
awakened into action by the strong power that
creates and controls them. See you the mighty
tide that swells up into universal motion, bearing
by its own strength the burthen of resistless
armaments as if they were but reeds, and when
it does put forth its power, assuming such shapes
and doing such things as make the marvel of
every age; and know you not that it is the
operation of its attraction for that fair world of
light that dwelleth in the starry heaven, whose
glimpses of a glory not to be subdued enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
into its innermost depths, and stir its everlasting
waves with passionate emotion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely one so young cannot have felt the
power of Love?&rdquo; asked the elder of the two, in
a tone that betrayed the influence of which it
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who shall say when it shall come or when
it shall depart?&rdquo; said Zabra, as the dusky hue
of his cheek gave evidence of the warm blood
that filled his veins. &ldquo;It is a presence that
appeareth at all times when the soul is fit to receive
it. It cometh not at this time, nor at that&mdash;it
dwelleth not here, nor there; it filleth eternity
of time, and infinity of space. Look around
you, over the vast circumference of boundless
nature&mdash;wherever there is life, wherever there
is motion&mdash;wherever there is an object that hath
beauty in its form and fitness for its purpose, it
hath all its energies swayed by the thrilling impulses
of that almighty passion. The flower
that liveth but a few days, trembles in the warm
embraces of the southern breeze; and the planet
that smiled upon the infancy of the world, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
unconquerable maturity of a thousand ages,
still enamoured, drinks in the beauty of the
mountain stream. The heart is ever young, as
mine is; and as the mellowing sunbeam calls
into activity the principle of life in the insect&rsquo;s
egg, the sunshine in which I have basked, hath
stirred the vital seed implanted within my
breast, and given it restless hopes and fond
desires, and properties and motives to an end,
that are the wings with which it flutters in its
shell. The only thing in which I differ from
the rest is that my Spring hath preceded theirs.
All have their seasons, but till the sun comes
the winter endures; and in me the frost hath
been broken up, and the current, freed from its
icy chains, rushes through its channels in the
soft light of its first bright day, and makes a
world of its own, full of music and flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can you bear to be parted from
the object with which your sympathies are so
closely united?&rdquo; asked master Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are inseparable,&rdquo; replied Zabra, as he
fixed his eyes on the inquirer, eloquent with
animation. &ldquo;Think you, you can part the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
melody from the voice by which it is sung?
The two cannot be severed; neither can the
spirit to which mine is linked be other than a
part of myself. I breathe its atmosphere&mdash;I enjoy
its presence&mdash;I share in its delights. Our bodies
may be set asunder by a plank; but you may
pile mountains upon mountains, and worlds
upon worlds between us, and yet our souls will
remain one and indivisible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much your voice and gestures remind
me of Eureka!&rdquo; remarked the merchant&rsquo;s son,
regarding with increasing interest the romantic
enthusiasm of his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what purpose than this was I sent?&rdquo;
asked the youth, as he turned away from the
gaze as if to examine some of the strings of his
instrument: then continued&mdash;&ldquo;If you loved her
with the same intense devotion with which she
regards you, you would not require to be reminded;
but, save in the color of our complexions,
there is so perfect a resemblance both in
our appearance and in our natures, that I might
recall her image to any one who has seen her
and seems likely to forget her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrong me, Zabra!&rdquo; cried the other
vehemently, &ldquo;if you imagine it possible that
I can forget her. It is she who hath filled these
veins with a quenchless fire that makes my whole
frame glow with a desire for lofty enterprise, to
attain a renown, and acquire a greatness worthy
of the love with which I have been honoured.
Since that proud day when I first beheld in her
lustrous eyes the light that created a new splendour
over the horizon of my happiness, I have
been shaking the chains that bound me to the
world, and, while yearning to emancipate myself
from its oppressive thraldoms, have sought how
I could best subdue it to my own ambitious
purposes. I worship the nobility of her nature,
and would have her behold in mine something
worthy of its intimate association. I would not
have her descend from the lofty pedestal on
which she is placed; therefore am I eager to win
my way to a like elevation&mdash;ay, and ascend
higher, if a loftier step there be&mdash;and there acknowledge
the greatness I have worshipped, and
everlastingly unite it to my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How little you know of her character, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
you think she values any thing except the spirit
to which she is attached,&rdquo; observed the page.
&ldquo;Did she care for the accidental difference of
birth that distinguishes you from her, you would
never have known of her affection, because it
could never have existed. They who love the idle
vanities of rank, set their hearts upon a garment,
a feather, a shining stone that is made to
adorn the person who possesses it; but it was not
such artificial worth that could attract Eureka.
That she would feel proud of any distinction
you might by the force of your own merit
acquire, is probable; but knowing the qualities
of your disposition, she holds them at
their full value, which could not be increased
in the slightest degree by all the honours you
might gain. It was her observation of a tendency
in you to seek after the unattainable, that
made her fearful it would lead you into danger;
and when she pressed me into this service, she
bade me warn you of the different perils it
would produce. I warn you now. Take heed of
indulging in these ambitious dreams. You have
the elements of greatness in your character;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
they ought to content you; and what you desire
are but the shadows of what you have. There is
another danger which is equally imminent; and
if you are as truly devoted to Eureka as she
hath ever been to you, you will pause before it
reaches you.&mdash;Your feverish pursuit after renown,
or power, or whatever delusive meteor it
may be that dazzles your eyes, only tends to
make you lose sight of that one true, steady,
and brilliant light that should be a glory in your
pathway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed his companion with
fervour&mdash;&ldquo;never can any ambitious dream of
mine lead me from that splendour out of which
it was created. My aspirations are a natural
result of the lofty source from which they
spring. They are but the reflections of her
excellence&mdash;and the signs of her presence;
and loving her, I could no more exist without
desiring to be great, than I could bask in the
sun&rsquo;s rays without acquiring warmth.&mdash;Besides,
had I not this stimulus to exertion, by what
means can I hope to make her mine. To the
merchant&rsquo;s son the Lord of Philadelphia would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
deny his daughter; but with Oriel Porphyry,
his equal in dignity and superior in power, the
honoured of all and the feared of many, he
would gladly seek an alliance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think not of what Eureka&rsquo;s ideas may
be on this subject?&rdquo; inquired Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think of them, but they cannot avail,&rdquo;
said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will avail!&rdquo; replied the youth emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked master Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be assured of this,&rdquo; said his young companion,
while again he seemed more attentive
to his harp than to his listener. &ldquo;If, in a reasonable
time, the obstacles that retard your
union still exist, she will point out a way by
which they may be honourably set aside, or acquiesce
in any plan with the same object in
view, which you may propose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How know you this?&rdquo; inquired the other
hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard her say it,&rdquo; said the page.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But before I return, her father may compel
her to enter into other arrangements.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Eureka has a will which is not to be compelled&mdash;she
will readily do that which is right&mdash;but
no power on earth could bend her inclinations
to an unjust purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she may be surrounded by dangers&mdash;subject
to every kind of suffering, and forced
to endure a thousand indignities from which
I have no power to rescue her,&rdquo; continued
master Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She <em>is</em> surrounded by dangers,&rdquo; said the
youth with emphasis&mdash;&ldquo;dangers new and
terrible to other minds; but of these she will
think nothing, and of what she may be obliged
to endure she will be equally regardless, as long
as she is possessed with the conviction, that he
for whom alone she suffers is not unmindful of
the sacrifices she has made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a strength in your words,&rdquo; said
the merchant, laying his hand upon the shoulder
of his companion, &ldquo;which there is no withstanding;
and your looks are even more
eloquent than your language. How is it
possible that one apparently so young should
have acquired that force of expression, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
depth of meaning, which breathes in every sentence
you express.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was taught early, and well,&rdquo; replied the
other, as his frame trembled slightly under the
touch of his companion. &ldquo;And as for my
speech&mdash;truth is always the most forcible. My
external frame may appear light and boyish;
but size is no safe guide for the judgment.
The ostrich never leaves the earth along which
it glides; but the eagle pierces the unfathomable
depths of air with an untiring wing, and
floats with eye undimmed within the scorching
rays of the eternal sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zabra, your nature is superior to the garb
you wear,&rdquo; said the elder, as he kindly took the
hand and gazed into the face of his more youthful
associate. &ldquo;I cannot allow you to be thus.
You must put away the page, and endeavour to
be the friend of Oriel Porphyry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By whatever title Oriel Porphyry can most
love Zabra, that title Zabra would most desire
to be,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then be it so,&rdquo; said his companion.
&ldquo;From henceforth you shall be my associate&mdash;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
friend&mdash;my brother. Any thing in the
ship that can extend your enjoyments shall be at
your disposal, and you may command the services
of every living creature it contains. We
will be together as often as possible, and the
greatest delight you can create, or I can indulge
in, will be for us to discourse of her in whose
affection I exist; that when I hear the magic
music of your voice, and meet the deep intelligence
of your gaze, the resemblance may make
me imagine that the blissful times have again returned,
when beneath the shadows of the
welcome trees we sat together till the noonday
hours ran on unnoticed to the twilight, and the
twilight deepened into evening, and still our
hands were clasped with the same gentle
pressure with which they first met, and still
our eyes looked into each other with the same
unspeakable meaning that was first created in
their mutual glances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps Oriel Porphyry would have said
more, but at that moment his companion withdrew
his hand, and with looks full of an empassioned
tenderness, as he struck an accompaniment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of harmonious chords, he sang the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Sound, oh Harp! some sweet and cheerful lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soft as the breath of eve o&rsquo;er mountain springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awhile the spirit of a brighter day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mingles its voice with thy rejoicing strings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thy rejoicing strings, oh Soul of Song!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bind the fond air with spells rained free and fast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as thy thrilling echoes roll along,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We&rsquo;ll raise again <strong>the Raptures of the Past</strong>!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">A welcome to the ear, oh Voice Divine!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which long as life, and kind as hope, shall last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with the wealth of an exhaustless mine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stores in our hearts <strong>the Treasures of the Past</strong>!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Sound, oh Harp! thy music once again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For now while I intrusive cares destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An impulse stirs within the heart and brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Strong with the power of everlasting joy.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For as thy trembling murmurs swell around,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still we embrace <strong>the Blessings of the Past</strong>.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the song concluded their hearts seemed
filled with a mutual sympathy which neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
could express; and Master Porphyry throwing
his arm round the young musician, and bringing
Zabra&rsquo;s arm round his own waist, drew him
to another part of the vessel without either
exchanging a word. In this attitude, the
youthful pair would have formed an admirable
study for a painter. The tall and manly form
of the merchant&rsquo;s son, his clear complexion and
noble countenance creating a perfect contrast
to the symmetrical, yet delicate, figure of his
companion, and the soft voluptuous character
of his more dark but not less beautiful features.</p>

<p>While these proceedings were going on, a
scene of a very different description was being
acted in a low, dark, narrow cabin in a secluded
part of the ship. By the light of a small lamp
that swung from the roof, the diminutive form
of Log the captain&rsquo;s clerk, with his little conceited
physiognomy, might be observed perched
upon a high stool engaged in writing, while the
more burly figure, but not more prepossessing
countenance, of Scrumpydike, lay extended on
some packages near his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Scrunch me, if this ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t the most miserable
sort o&rsquo; life, I ever knowed,&rdquo; remarked the latter,
as he rested his chin upon his hands and supported
himself upon his elbows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sad!&rdquo; responded Log, who thinking that
to speak much would lessen his consequence,
seldom allowed any thing beyond a monosyllable
to escape him, to which by repetitions and some
slight additions he attempted to give as much
importance as if they contained volumes of
meaning. &ldquo;Sad, sad, very sad, very sad
upon my word, Mister Scrumpydike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; continued the
other. &ldquo;I feel as queer as a dog wi&rsquo; his tail
cut off, cause there&rsquo;s no &rsquo;portunity to do
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing, decidedly, actually,
positively nothing, Mister Scrumpydike,&rdquo; replied
the little man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tarnation hard case that a fellow&rsquo;s
obligated to be honest against his will,&rdquo; remarked
the sailor despondingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard, hard, very hard, very hard indeed,
uncommonly hard, Mister Scrumpydike,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the other, appearing to sympathise exceedingly
in so extraordinary a cause of complaint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s most cruel in this here unnat&rsquo;ral
state o&rsquo; things is, that there&rsquo;s sich lots o&rsquo; beautiful
prigging for any chap as is a mind to
make his-self handy,&rdquo; added his companion in
the same pathetic tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cruel, cruel, most cruel, most unjustly,
most unnaturally, most deplorably cruel, Mister
Scrumpydike,&rdquo; responded Log.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I only knows I shan&rsquo;t be able to stand
this here molloncolly sort o&rsquo; fun much longer.
May I be bolted by a shark if I ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a getting
into the most &rsquo;bominable reg&rsquo;lar habits as can
be. You wouldn&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose it possible, but I
ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t &rsquo;propriated nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; nobodies since I&rsquo;ve
been aboard this here craft. I ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t the same
sort o&rsquo; cretur I was afore. I ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, indeed.
I resists temptation, and commits lots o&rsquo; other
&rsquo;straordinary impossibilities. I does without divarsion:&mdash;I
ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t killed a fellow cretur for
ever so long. And worser nor all, some o&rsquo;
the bugaboos here act&rsquo;ly thinks I ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
greater a villain than themselves, ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it
horrid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Terrible, terrible, horribly terrible, upon
my word, very horribly terrible, Mister Scrumpydike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the dialogue was interrupted by a
knocking at the door which made Scrumpydike
jump upon his legs, and Log twist himself
round upon his stool, each looking, in a
considerable degree, alarmed and anxious.
Presently the door opened cautiously, and
Captain Compass entered the cabin. His
sallow complexion, high cheek bones, prominent
nose, thick lips, and restless grey eyes
were surrounded by a thick mass of coarse
black hair, that spread from each side of his
narrow forehead, down his cheeks and under
his chin, in a formidable pair of whiskers.
His figure was spare of flesh, but in the
gauntness of body, length of arm, and sinewy
leg, there was evidently more than ordinary
strength. His appearance was not likely to
excite for him much regard, but there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
careless freedom in his manner, a frank boldness
in his conversation, and a pungent satire
in his wit, that had made him an agreeable
companion to the merchant&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Scrumpy?&rdquo; inquired Compass
in a whisper, after closing the door carefully
after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, cap&rsquo;ain,&rdquo; replied Scrumpydike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right, right, very right, perfectly right,
right as a trivet, Captain Compass,&rdquo; added
Log.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scrunch me, if we shan&rsquo;t all be served with
sauce we don&rsquo;t like, unless we keep a smart look
out ahead,&rdquo; observed the captain as he flung
himself upon a bale of goods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s in the wind now, cap&rsquo;ain?&rdquo;
inquired Scrumpydike, with some earnestness,
while little Log remained silent with alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I be peeled to shreds in a hurricane,
if that dark looking son of a savage, who came
on board the day we sailed, doesn&rsquo;t suspect the
game we are playing,&rdquo; continued the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, as an expression
of anxiety became visible in his hard rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
features; and the captain&rsquo;s clerk trembled on
his stool as if he was shaken by an ague.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was palavering young Porphyry as smooth
as a rat&rsquo;s tail, after he had been pretty well
blown up with the long-winded sentences of
that tedious old porpoise Fortyfolios, and was
going it at a smacking rate about the pleasure
of liberty and the enjoyments of a life of enterprise,
the sort of discourse, I have found out,
he&rsquo;ll suck in as a fish drinks water, when happening
to turn my daylights a little a starboard,
I beheld that black thief Zabra watching me
like a snake, and when I met the full stare of
his great goggling eyes they seemed to have the
power of piercing through and through right
into the hold where all my secrets are ballasted,
so I, having a sudden fear that he was up to the
course I was steering, lost the helm of my discourse,
and anchored in shallow water, with a
muddy bottom, in no time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; responded Scrumpydike: &ldquo;is that
all? Leave him to me, and I&rsquo;ll thank ye for
the job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that mustn&rsquo;t be: we must avoid every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
thing likely to create the least suspicion,&rdquo;
replied the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; said the other: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
watch my &rsquo;portunity when he&rsquo;s a hanging over
the side o&rsquo; the ship, as he does o&rsquo; nights when
there ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a human near enough to catch a
glimpse o&rsquo; his &rsquo;bominable carcass, and then with
my &lsquo;safe and sure&rsquo; here,&rdquo; continued the fellow
as he drew a long knife a little way from its
concealment in his vest, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a sweep
into his bread-room, and afore he can ax what
it&rsquo;s for, I&rsquo;ll heave him into a berth where he&rsquo;ll
lie snug as a wet blanket can make him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t do, I tell you,&rdquo; remarked his
associate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody needn&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about it,&rdquo;
added Scrumpydike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is too much risk and not sufficient
advantage to be gained by it,&rdquo; said the captain.
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he continued, after a pause&mdash;&ldquo;if I only
had some of the old hands now, scrunch me, if
I wouldn&rsquo;t put matters to rights, after a fashion
the fellows here don&rsquo;t dream of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t we? Breakers ahead! wouldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
we?&rdquo; cried the other with exultation. &ldquo;But
they&rsquo;ve all cut their cables and gone adrift.
There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but misfortunes in this here
world. It&rsquo;s a hard case for a fellow who&rsquo;s
sociably inclined to see his mates, as fine a set o&rsquo;
villains as ever escaped hanging, partin&rsquo; company
without cuttin&rsquo; each other&rsquo;s throats or doin&rsquo;
any thing in a friendly way.&rdquo; A melancholy
pause succeeded this sentence.&mdash;&ldquo;It was an
ugly business that at Cape Danger, warn&rsquo;t it,
Mister Log?&rdquo; at last asked the scoundrel of
the little man upon the stool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugly, ugly, very ugly, I may say uncommonly,
deplorably, ferociously ugly, Mister
Scrumpydike,&rdquo; replied the captain&rsquo;s clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use lamenting the catastrophe
now,&rdquo; observed the captain. &ldquo;All we&rsquo;ve got
to do is to get a new ship and a fresh set of
hands. The ship we&rsquo;ve as good as got, but she
can be of no use without a crew of the right sort.
To get such a set of fellows together will take
some time. We must either pick them up
where we can, or try and make the present crew
adopt our views. This will be rather a ticklish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
business, and requires very careful management,
for the slightest knowledge of our intentions
among those not inclined to join us will wreck
the whole concern. Now, Scrumpy, you&rsquo;ve got
jawing tackle that will stand in any weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, cap&rsquo;ain,&rdquo; cried the fellow with a
grin: &ldquo;may I be washed to rags in a waterspout
if I couldn&rsquo;t bamboozle the devil&rsquo;s grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you must sound these fellows, but
do it cautiously&mdash;and try if the inducement of
plenty of plunder and a free life will be likely
to lead them to assist us in our bold undertaking.
As for the boy Zabra, although there appears
something very mysterious about him, and he
looks as sharp as a sword-fish, I don&rsquo;t think it
possible he can find me out. Scorch my body
to a cinder! but it would be a hard case if, after
having baffled so many big vessels, I should be
sunk by such a bit of a craft as that. However,
I mus&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay here any longer or my absence
may create inquiry,&rdquo; observed the speaker as
he proceeded to the door; then looking at his
associates said, &ldquo;Remember what you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
heard, and steer your course accordingly,&rdquo;
and with the same caution with which he
entered left the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t this enough to make a fellow
ready to jump down his own throat wi&rsquo;
vexation?&rdquo; remarked Scrumpydike to his
companion. &ldquo;Here, I was jest &rsquo;gratulating
myself that spiflicating that young blackamoor
would be a tolerable bit o&rsquo; a pastime to cheer
up the dulness o&rsquo; this here molloncholy life,
when he turns round upon me and says it ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
to be at no price! I&rsquo;d rather live in a whale&rsquo;s
belly up to my nose in blubber than endure
this uncomfortable state o&rsquo; feeling. Scrunch
me if I wouldn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t you think now,
Master Log, it&rsquo;s as bad a state o&rsquo; existence as
is possible for a human to know on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad, bad, shocking bad, particularly
shocking bad, upon my word very particularly
shocking bad, Mister Scrumpydike,&rdquo; replied
the commiserating captain&rsquo;s clerk; and immediately
afterwards the dissatisfied villain walked
away to join his unsuspicious messmates.</p>

been related, Oriel Porphyry, being alone,
broke open the packet that had been given
him by his father, and on perusal found it
to contain the following communication:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time, my dear Oriel, that you should
know something of your father&rsquo;s history; that
being made acquainted with the steps by which
he has acquired his reputation, you may seek
the same path to honour with a certainty that
it cannot mislead; and the moment is equally
opportune for you to learn the true state of
your country, which you cannot know unless
you can have the account from one who is
neither desirous of deceiving himself nor his
associates, that when you are called upon to
take your place on the grand stage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
world, as you will be aware what portion of the
drama has preceded your appearance, you
may understand the tendency of the whole so
well, as to be able to play your part with
power, with truth, with a just conception of
the character, to the satisfaction of yourself,
and with the admiration of your audience. I
have observed, with considerable anxiety, that
you possess a disposition that does not conform
itself readily to the spirit of the times. You are
impatient of restraint&mdash;you are anxious for
enterprise&mdash;you are yearning for distinction;&mdash;not
that distinction which rewards the exertions
of the truly great, the just, the good,
the benevolent&mdash;which is the loving admiration
of their fellow-creatures, and comes in the
delightful shape of blessings, and good wishes,
and the sight of social happiness&mdash;but the
vain splendour of a false renown, such as is
often acquired by adventurers, impostors, conquerors,
and tyrants, and is made visible in the
shrieks of wounded men, in the adulation of
slaves, in tears and curses, blood and flame,
in the blast of trumpets and the clang of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
chains. Your eyes are enamoured of the
glory with which the mighty invest themselves:
to excite the wonder of the fearful and the
foolish, and assist in their subjection&mdash;thrones
and sceptres, robes of state, gaudy
ceremonies, and idle distinctions, dazzle your
senses&mdash;you would wish them yours, seek for
them, fight for them, die for them: having
obtained them, your sole gratification would
exist in exhibiting yourself surrounded by these
delusive honours, or in conferring some of minor
importance upon such of your followers as may
make themselves most useful or agreeable:
dying in seeking their possession, you would
render up your everlasting soul, to mingle with
the bright source from which it sprung, with
the sole consolation that you will be talked of
by a multitude you could not enslave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only unerring way of judging of the
value of a thing is by the happiness it produces.
The degree of happiness that results to the acquirer
of this glory, of which you are so desirous,
must indeed be small, when we take into consideration
the danger with which it is obtained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the fear of losing it, and the struggles to maintain
its possession, which are its common accompaniments;
and still less is the quantity of
happiness it creates among those at whose expense
it must exist&mdash;for there is no happiness in
thraldom&mdash;in the debasement of human nature
to an idol&mdash;in the march of conquering hordes
destroying as they go&mdash;or in the bitter anguish
of noble minds struggling in vain to emancipate
themselves from the tyranny under which they
groan. The only real happiness consists in the
practice of benevolence, and the only real glory
is the admiration it excites. I have enjoyed
a more than ordinary share of happiness, because
I have taken advantage of opportunities
for benefiting my fellow-creatures that were
presented to me in more than ordinary abundance,
and I have acquired an unusual degree of
reputation for a private individual, in consequence
of making the most profitable use of
these abundant opportunities for doing good.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in the middle of the last reign, when
the late emperor, after ascending the steps of
military greatness to a throne, was pursuing an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
uninterrupted career of conquest throughout the
vast continent of this immense portion of the
globe, when I, a youth like yourself, but with
far different feelings, left the mansion of my
father, (who had lately been ennobled, as it is
called, for his services in the wars,) to escape
from a way of life it was desired I, being his
eldest son, should follow&mdash;a way of slaughter
and tyranny, of blood, and shame, and guilt,
which was disgustingly repugnant to my disposition,&mdash;and
disguised, and under a fictitious
name, seeking some more honourable occupation,
I was so fortunate as to enter into the
service of the wealthiest merchant in the city of
Columbus. I became useful to him&mdash;he
praised my industry and integrity&mdash;I was admired
by his daughter&mdash;she loved me for the
praises to which she had been a frequent and
not unwilling listener. He was generous and
noble in his nature&mdash;she simple, modest, and
kind. She was your mother, Oriel, and
after having been enriched with her beauty and
excellence, I became possessed of all the store
of treasure, which had gone on accumulating as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
it passed from father to son through several
generations of princely merchants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had always done whatever trifling good
the little power I had allowed me to accomplish,
and the sweetest gratifications I enjoyed arose
from these actions, and had always longed for
the arrival of that time when my sphere of usefulness
might be equal to my desires; therefore
when, by the demise of my adopted father, I
found myself the uncontrollable master of funds
almost exhaustless, to render the benefits I
wished them to produce as ample as possible, I
studied every way which great knowledge and
extraordinary means could create to increase
them, that without diminishing my source of
good I might have a liberal, a continual, and
increasing fund from which to realise my benevolent
intentions. With this object in view,
and with the experience I had acquired by
many years of close application, I brought into
operation all my resources&mdash;my ships, continually
increasing in number, traversed every
known sea, laden with the most desirable produce&mdash;and
my agents, always becoming more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
numerous, penetrated into every habitable region,
and opened new sources of traffic and
fresh accumulations of wealth. The consequence
was, that I was enabled to live a life of the most
active benevolence. I purchased happiness by
diffusing it around me. I founded hospitals for
the sick and asylums for the poor. I endeavoured
to lessen the growth of crime by increasing
the means of intelligence, and I attempted
to strengthen the example of virtue by adding
to the recreative power of its advantages. I
rewarded genius, I enriched worth, I assisted
industry, I fostered skill. I made disappointment
forget her name, and allowed misfortune
to become a stranger in the places where I was
known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But at this period, in what state of feeling
lived the emperor&mdash;he whose state you would
envy, and whose pride you would covet? He
was getting into the winter of his days, but the
fire that burnt within him was not to be subdued
by its frost. His soul was like a volcano
in a region of snow. He was disturbed by the
restless turmoil of his own thoughts, that made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
his couch of down a bed of rock, his robe of
sovereignty a perpetual blister, and the acclamations
of a fickle multitude a piercing discord.
In vain, when he found that all his conquests
had been achieved, and he consolidated them
into one immense empire, comprising the two
Americas, over which he ruled alone and absolute,
he tried to calm the fever of his desires
by building palaces and churches, erecting triumphal
arches and towering pillars&mdash;creating
convenient highways, majestic bridges, noble
aqueducts, immense canals, and unrivalled docks:&mdash;in
vain he strived to have forests grow in the
place of weeds, and sought to have gardens of
roses in deserts of sand&mdash;he encouraged agriculture&mdash;he
promoted manufactures&mdash;he protected
commerce&mdash;science was ennobled in his
halls, and learning dwelt in comfort in his
colleges:&mdash;in vain he established institutions,
originated titles, conferred honours, and distributed
wealth&mdash;the fire that slumbered in his
breast was not to be thus extinguished. He
was miserable for want of opportunities for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
action. His busy inclinations allowed him no
repose. There was no peace for his soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The happiness I enjoyed became known to
him&mdash;became familiar to all&mdash;for with the
true spirit of philanthropy, which knows no distinction
of creed or country, I endeavoured to
confer my benefits wherever they were most
required; and the loving admiration with which
I found my name regarded in every part of the
globe, and the abundant pleasures I saw arise
from my own exertions wherever they could be
applied, created in me a degree of happiness
almost impossible to be exceeded. He became
aware of my extraordinary wealth, and was told
of the beneficial effects it was producing. The
emperor sent me word that a certain distinction
waited my acceptance&mdash;with a proper humility
I declined the favour. Surprised at the refusal,
and desirous of tempting me into obligation, he
caused it to be intimated to me that a higher
honour would, if desired, be granted&mdash;this, in
the same manner, and with as little consideration,
I also refused. His astonishment increased,
and his inclination to shackle me with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the trappings of his own grandeur grew more
intense. I was told that the highest honours to
which a subject could aspire might at a wish be
mine; and I need scarcely add that the offer
met with the same result as its predecessors.
No, my son! as Oriel Porphyry I had acquired
almost boundless riches, and had lived in a state
of happiness which left no desire ungratified&mdash;as
Oriel Porphyry I had obtained an influence
over the hearts of my fellow-men, compared to
which the power of conquerors was an idle
boast&mdash;and as Oriel Porphyry I had created for
myself a renown beside which the glory of an
emperor sunk into insignificance. What could
be to me the baubles he sought to confer&mdash;the
sounding titles&mdash;or the pompous privileges?
They could not extend my usefulness a hair&rsquo;s
breadth&mdash;they could not add to my enjoyments
the fraction of a grain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To say that the emperor was not offended
by my repeated refusals would be to give a
more charitable interpretation to his feelings
than would be true; but my behaviour seemed
to him something so extraordinary&mdash;something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
so opposed to the spirit of his experience&mdash;and
something so utterly incomprehensible to his
notions of human nature&mdash;that he sent for me
to be satisfied by his own eyes that there existed
in the world what he considered so remarkable
a phenomenon. He endeavoured to persuade
me into a conviction that I did wrong, in not
accepting the advantages, as he was pleased to
call them, I might obtain; and I replied by
describing the advantages that more justly deserved
the name I already possessed. I asked
if he could give me any thing of real value
that was not at my disposal, and enumerated
every good I was enabled to bestow. He reflected,
and the more he reflected, the more he
seemed to wonder. I do not remember the whole
of our conversation, but it was of sufficient interest
to him to desire my visit to be repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the emperor frequently at his continual
requests, and the more I conversed with
him the more he appeared gratified with my
conversation. I expressed my opinions fearlessly,
and my boldness he excused&mdash;I censured
his government with freedom, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
listened without offence. I suggested some valuable
improvements, and my ideas were immediately
adopted; but our acquaintance did not
end there. He was continually entreating me
to occupy a place in his council, from which I
endeavoured to be excused; but on reflection,
seeing that it might confer upon me opportunities
I could not otherwise possess, for giving a
more liberal character to the government, by
which means I might improve the condition of the
people, I at last consented, on the understanding
that it should confer on me no rank, no privileges,
and no emoluments. I knew that my
country had once been a republic, and under
that title had for centuries enjoyed an unexampled
degree of prosperity; but though I
would have preferred a government of a similar
character, more perfect in its influence, and
more simple in its organisation, as a change in
the state of things could not evidently be made,
without creating a degree of confusion, strife,
hatred, and unhappiness, the thought of which I
could not endure, it was my aim so to work
and improve the machinery of the state, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
public wants should be as completely satisfied as
it was possible for them to be. It matters little
under what name a nation is governed,&mdash;a
monarchy, an oligarchy, and a republic are but
different names for the same thing; and a president,
a doge, and an emperor, are only different
titles for the same office: they may all
represent a state of tyranny in the country, and
their chiefs may become the most despotic rulers
of the people. The true value of a thing, as I
have previously said, is the quantity of happiness
it can be made to produce; and every system
of government may, by proper administration,
be made productive of the greatest degree
of happiness to the governed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the head of the grand council of the
empire I was in due time installed; and while
I there remained, was the originator of a multitude
of various measures, having for their object
the public welfare. My coadjutors I found to
be men with whom I could but little sympathise,
because they had no sympathy for their fellows.
They were proud, vain, selfish, and intolerant.
They imagined themselves governors instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
ministers. They liked to rule better than to advise.
They bowed in abject servility to their superior,
and strived to make those having less
power as slavish in their behaviour to themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not at all extraordinary that such dispositions
should regard the untitled merchant
who presided at their deliberations, always
exercised his own judgment in preference
to theirs, paid no deference to their fancied
superiority, and appeared on terms of equality
even with their emperor, as one unqualified for
government, and solely kept in office by the
emperor&rsquo;s foolish partiality; and I was neither
surprised or offended, when I found them opposing
the measures I brought forward; treating
my arguments with inattention, and my
person with disrespect. Finding that, under
such circumstances, my services could be of no
value to the community, I was obliged to request
the emperor to release me from the
responsibilities of my situation. He desired to
know the reasons for my resignation. I told
him. I was entreated to remain; an intimation
was conveyed to the members of the council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
from him they acknowledged as their master,
and, when I returned to my duties, I found
them rivalling each other in obsequiousness to
my will. That, notwithstanding the readiness
with which they embraced my views, they
hated me in their hearts, I regret to say, was
too evident. But they were little to be
blamed. Had they known that, even in the
idle rank which they prized so highly, I was
the equal of the noblest, and the superior of
the rest, they would have regarded me with
more generous feelings; but none knew when
my father died, and my younger brother took
possession of the titles and estates of the family;
that the rightful heir, long lamented as dead,
was living, in the person of an object of secret
disdain to his coadjutors; and that he was
Oriel Porphyry, the merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may easily be imagined by you, from
what I have related, that the emperor had
sympathies in his nature rarely met with in
conquerors; but by me they were first awakened.
On one of our earliest interviews, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the spirit that kept his desires in a ferment was
still strong upon him, he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want action&mdash;I want action. I cannot
live except in the stir of battle, and the pursuit
of conquest. But my triumphs are completed&mdash;I
have nothing left to conquer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the most valuable&mdash;the
most difficult conquest remains unachieved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What have I to conquer?&rsquo; he asked,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yourself,&rdquo; I replied. I will do him the
justice to say that he did not lose sight of the
suggestion. His mind became liberalised&mdash;his
heart expanded to the influence of sincere
philanthropy&mdash;for the first time he understood
the nature of true happiness; and although
from the effects of a disease of long standing
his reign, from this time, was brief, he lived to
effect some valuable reformations in the laws,
and by their results in ameliorating the condition
of the people, provided, as far as he had
the power, a remedy for the mischiefs he had
created.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His successor was a weak, proud, vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
young man, possessing a disposition for tyranny&mdash;usually
found in company with incapacity
holding power; and it is almost unnecessary to
state that such a character found plenty of bad
advisers, and that I was speedily obliged by
their machinations to retire from all participation
in the government. Although my time
had always been actively employed, I had regarded
the progress of your education with so
much interest, that I never failed to create opportunities
for superintending your studies. I
witnessed the developement of your mind with
increasing pleasure, and found a continual gratification
in the approaches you were making
to the perfect dignity of manhood. About this
time we went to reside in the neighbourhood
of Philadelphia&rsquo;s noble mansion, because the
scenery was endeared to me by all the most
pleasant of my early recollections, and I encouraged
your intimacy with our proud neighbours,
in consequence of an inclination I had
long retained, which was created in me by
many powerful reasons with which you cannot
now be made acquainted, for a union between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
our families. Philadelphia seemed for a considerable
time with great cordiality to enter
into my views; but as the government of which
he was a supporter were pursuing measures
highly inimical to the liberties of the people,
and as he found I would not be brought into
any thing like an approval of such a policy,
he began to look upon me with less friendship&mdash;he
thought it would hurt his loyalty to retain
feelings of sociality for one who opposed the
measures of his sovereign, and imagined it beneath
the dignity of his nobility to encourage
an alliance with an untitled merchant. But
he little knew that a word would make me his
equal in his own ideas of greatness; which,
when uttered, would at the same time reduce
him to a state of insignificance to which, in
comparison, my plebeian condition would have
appeared to him princely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From a friendly neighbour, Philadelphia
became an implacable enemy. I regretted, for
the reasons to which I have alluded, that all
idea of the proposed union should be thus suddenly
terminated; but I had noticed in Eureka<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
so powerful a romantic impulse in her nature,
and observed that its effect upon you was so
productive of ambitious desires, that I did not
lament your separation, but in a very slight
degree. The disappointment under which I
observed you suffer so acutely, and the restless
eagerness for a life of enterprise, I noticed becoming
in you daily less supportable, induced
me to plan the voyage upon which you are now
proceeding. Engage yourself in careful observation
of every thing you meet worthy of notice&mdash;seek
every opportunity for diffusing happiness
among those near you, by whom it may be
required; and all motive for exertion, that does
not tend towards benevolence, all regret for the
past, and all desires for the future, will be forgotten
in the enjoyment of your own happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot be,&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel Porphyry, as
he concluded the preceding sentence. &ldquo;I
honour my father&rsquo;s noble nature, and would do
all in my power to fulfil his benevolent intentions,
but I cannot give up Eureka. My ambition
I will strive to conquer; but love is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
so easily subdued. What care I for the disdain of
the proud Philadelphia? I see signs in the times
that are likely to bring about important changes,
if this state of things continues. The people are
dissatisfied with their rulers, and the emperor is
endeavouring to make himself absolute. Every
day will increase the public discontent, and
when the crisis arrives, there will be nothing
required but a leader, and down the whole rotten
fabric of despotism must tumble. I will wait
the time; and then, my father! we will see
who is greatest in the land&mdash;the generous merchant
or the proud noble.&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<span class="f8">A FIRE AT SEA.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> mid-day meal had concluded in the chief
cabin, and its partakers were grouped round a
table in the centre of the apartment, assisting
with conversation the enjoyment of the wines
and delicacies of which they were partaking.
The cabin was elegant in its decorations, but
they were marked by a more valuable quality
than mere elegance: the pictures and other ornaments,
possessing features of peculiar interest
to persons engaged in traffic, for they represented,
or were connected in some way with
the objects, the pleasures, and the advantages of
commerce; some weapons arranged in a picturesque
manner, and placed amongst them by
Oriel Porphyry, were the only things there
seen that did not partake of the peaceful character
of the appearance of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing I can see in nature,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Captain Compass, as he sat at one end of the
table opposite Oriel Porphyry, re-filling his
glass, &ldquo;and the only thing I think worth seeing
is glory. May I sink to the bottom of the
sea in the next gale, if there&rsquo;s any thing else a
fellow should wish to possess. What do you say,
master Porphyry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I must acknowledge it has extraordinary
attractions,&rdquo; replied the young merchant.
&ldquo;It is generally difficult to obtain,&mdash;its pursuit
is usually attended with much hazard, but then
there is such an excitement in the effort made
to possess it, and such a splendour accompanying
its possession, that difficulties and dangers ought
not to be considered by those by whom it is
sought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; responded the captain, with more
than usual cordiality; &ldquo;and they only can obtain
glory who express such sentiments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is uncertain as yet what definition
you give to the idea you call glory,&rdquo; remarked
the oldest member of the party,&mdash;a man rather
above the medium height, and considerably beyond
the middle age, with a large head, nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
bald, prominent nose, and deep-set eyes, well
shaded by a pair of thick grisly eyebrows. His
features were somewhat stern in their expression,
apparently more from the result of continual
reflection than from want of kindly feeling;
and although they indicated considerable
mental power, a consciousness of superiority betrayed
itself quite as conspicuously. It may
easily be imagined that this was the learned
Professor Fortyfolios. &ldquo;The consideration of
any abstract idea,&rdquo; continued the professor,
who, it will be observed, having been a public
lecturer in the university of Columbus, had acquired
a more important manner of expressing
his sentiments than was usual in conversation.
&ldquo;The consideration of any abstract idea, appears
under different circumstances in the minds
of different individuals, but this is as much the result
of an habitual tendency to certain associations
in the person who considers the subject, as the
consequence of the variety of organisations that
exist in society. Scarcely any two persons are
to be met with whose reflective faculties pursue
the progress of ratiocination exactly in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
manner,&mdash;because no two individuals being exactly
alike, and the mind being a portion of the
self, partaking of its individuality, as in a mirror,
the shadow is a resemblance of the features,
each must receive its own separate impressions,
and consider them in its own peculiar manner.
It follows, as a natural consequence, that the
thoughts of the speaker will partake of his individual
habitude, and that his conception of glory,
or any other abstract idea, will be coloured by
his particular way of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know in what latitude abstract
ideas may be found,&rdquo; said the captain, a little
puzzled by the professor&rsquo;s explanation; &ldquo;but I
think any body knows the landmarks of glory. If
I saw a little ship manned by a few brave spirits,
fight a ship double its size, or may be two ships
or may be three, defended by a crew as superior
in numbers; and after raking her fore and aft,
smashing every thing to splinters, and cutting
every thing to rags, pipe all hands to board, and
sweep away the enemy from their own decks into
the sea, and after that sail away with the prize,
I should call <em>that</em> glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The action is glorious no doubt,&rdquo; observed
Oriel Porphyry, &ldquo;but it does not realise my
conception of glory. I imagine a man, in the
truest sense of the word, living in a country
groaning under the despotism of a tyrant, and
having that spirit of freedom in his nature,
which must always accompany greatness; and
that uncontrollable energy of valour in his character,
which is its element, pointing out to his
fellow-sufferers the cause of their slavery, stirring
in their hearts an unconquerable love of independence,
and after gathering them together
by twos and threes, then by hundreds and thousands,
and lastly, by resistless multitudes, at
their head attacking the hordes of armed plunderers
by whom their subjugation had been
effected; driving them from the tented field
to the battlemented wall, and from the battlemented
wall to the grave; and when not a trace
of tyranny remained throughout the land, I
imagine that man the liberator of his country,
and the emancipator of its people, honoured as
he ought to be, and possessed with the power
with which their gratitude should invest him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
conducting the nation he had enfranchised to
the highest degree of prosperity and greatness&mdash;and
I call <em>that</em> glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then my notion of the same idea differs materially
from those you have given,&rdquo; said the
professor. &ldquo;In the first place, there are two
antagonist principles, from which all good and
ill emanate&mdash;intelligence and ignorance; and
only according to the predominance of the
former can we judge of the extent of the excellence
of any thing. As we know that all which
is beneficial proceeds from intelligence, and that
without intelligence nothing good can arise, and
that without good there can be no such thing as
glory, it must be evident that he who produces
intelligence acquires the truest and greatest
glory. The philosopher who spends laborious
days in amassing knowledge by observation
and study, which he distributes to the whole
world, and whose labours continue to the end
of time to ennoble and refine mankind; in the
fame with which his name must be inseparably
connected among all generations, and wherever
civilisation exists, realises, in my opinion, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<em>only</em> true idea of glory the human mind can
conceive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg leave to differ from you all,&rdquo; cried a
stout little man (whose round, rosy face bore
the perfect expression of good humour), sitting
opposite the professor, and whose professional
conversation proclaimed him to be Dr. Tourniquet,
&ldquo;I beg leave to differ from you all, don&rsquo;t
you see. I cannot imagine glory to belong to
anything that does not tend to alleviate the sufferings
or remove the diseases of the human
frame, don&rsquo;t you see. Life is subject to a multitude
of maladies&mdash;from the cradle to the
grave there is a constant succession of aches and
pains, and few escape without experiencing disorders
more or less dreadful. Now my idea is,
that evil and good are but other names for pain
and pleasure, don&rsquo;t you see; that he who lessens
the quantity of evil is alone entitled to the name
of benefactor, which brings with it the greatest
degree of glory it is possible to possess, don&rsquo;t
you see; and that, consequently, the man who
devotes his life to procure others the enjoyment
of health&mdash;who boldly ventures among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
most malignant contagions to study their effects,
and origins&mdash;who carefully examines every
morbid structure in the living and the dead, at
the greatest personal risk and inconvenience,
till he becomes familiar with all its appearances
and discovers its creating cause; and by long
study of the properties of different medicinal
substances, of external circumstances that tend
to produce health or disease, and by his intimate
acquaintance with the human body in every
state in which it can be seen;&mdash;in my opinion,
that man, who by knowledge thus acquired, and
thus applied, through his example made public,
being enabled to save or prolong the lives of
millions of his fellow-creatures, and multiply the
blessings of existence, in the admiration with
which his name must always be regarded, is the
<em>only</em> perfect conception of glory that can be entertained,
don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh, pooh!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain, somewhat
contemptuously. &ldquo;What glory can there
be in giving a fellow a dose of physic?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless there be some ennobling sentiment
in the mind, which is developed in great actions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
such as I have described, glory cannot exist,&rdquo;
said Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strife must always be a bad means to whatever
end it may lead,&rdquo; observed his tutor; &ldquo;and
as nothing but ignorance can make men endeavour
to destroy each other, strife can never be
productive of true glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The amount of pain, resulting from battles
either on sea or land, is immense,&rdquo; remarked
the doctor. &ldquo;Gunshot wounds, fractures, contusions,
ruptures, laceration, inflammation, suppuration,
mortification, and death; and, therefore,
he who creates so much pain, cannot, by
his actions, be said to achieve anything like
glory, don&rsquo;t you see. As for philosophy and its
qualifications for being considered the only
thing that is most glorious, if the philosopher
cannot set a broken bone, or remove a disease,
pain must exist in spite of such philosophy; and
therefore, the philosopher, who is enabled to
prevent or remove pain, has the best reason to
glory in his philosophy, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But pain cannot, on many occasions, be
either removed or prevented,&rdquo; replied the professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
seemingly preparing himself for an argument.
&ldquo;Pain is frequently produced by accidents
which cannot be foreseen, and therefore
cannot be prevented; and these frequently
assume shapes on which science is exerted in
vain, and therefore they cannot be removed: in
these cases, where surgery and medicine are
perfectly useless, philosophy is triumphant; for
it will enable the sufferer to be regardless of his
pain, and to look upon his dissolution with indifference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the use of your philosophy to the
insane?&rdquo; asked the doctor, who seemed to take
considerable delight in opposing the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should imagine it would be about as serviceable
as your medical treatment,&rdquo; retorted
the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; replied his antagonist
with a chuckle of triumphant congratulation.
&ldquo;A knowledge of the anatomy of the brain, its
functions, and operations, with sufficient information
as to the patient&rsquo;s history, general habits
and mode of thinking, applied by an experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
practitioner, may often effect a cure, don&rsquo;t you
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May often, but how often?&rdquo; inquired
Fortyfolios, with some appearance of sarcasm.
&ldquo;To one restored to sanity, there will be found
fifty incurables&mdash;so where&rsquo;s your remedy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To one philosopher there will be discovered
a thousand fools, don&rsquo;t you see&mdash;so where&rsquo;s
your philosophy?&rdquo; responded the other in a
similar tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Tourniquet,&rdquo; replied the professor with
a look of offended dignity, &ldquo;I trust my philosophy
will be found whenever it is required.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Fortyfolios,&rdquo; said the doctor,
evidently desirous of pushing matters with his
antagonist as far as possible, &ldquo;if you wait till
it&rsquo;s required, perhaps you may have to wait a
long time, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No Sir, I don&rsquo;t see!&rdquo; cried the now angry
Professor with much warmth. &ldquo;And allow me
to add, Dr. Tourniquet&mdash;allow me to add, I
say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wine, if you please,&rdquo; cried Oriel Porphyry,
who, with the captain, had enjoyed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
discussion till he thought it necessary to interfere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, the wine, Professor Fortyfolios,&rdquo; repeated
the doctor, with his usual good humour.
&ldquo;It is the most admirable addition to your excellent
arguments you could have conceived;
and, therefore, as a mark of sincere respect for
your superior learning, allow me to propose your
health, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor recovered his dignity immediately.
&ldquo;I agree completely,&rdquo; said he, after
having properly acknowledged the compliment
he had received, &ldquo;I agree completely with
the opinion of my accomplished friend, as to the
great degree of pain produced by warfare,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Froth and moonshine!&rdquo; exclaimed the
captain, interrupting him. &ldquo;Why we must all
die some day or other, and it is quite as agreeable
to strike your colours to a bullet or a sword
thrust, as to old age or the gout. In my opinion,
a fellow who lives past his strength, is like
a ship that isn&rsquo;t sea-worthy,&mdash;he ought to be destroyed
as useless. As for fighting being unnatural,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
it&rsquo;s the most natural thing in nature.
In the sea, the big fish destroy the little fish;
in the air, the great birds prey upon the smaller
ones; and on the land, the more powerful
animals devour those of less strength. Every
thing has to fight for its existence, and so does
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But man alone preys upon his own species,&rdquo;
remarked the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re out of your reckoning there, most
decidedly, Mister Professor,&rdquo; replied Captain
Compass hastily: &ldquo;cocks, quails, pheasants,
bulls, deer, dogs, and cats fight each other, as
long as they&rsquo;ve got a leg to stand upon; and
the sow devours her own farrow, and the rabbit
her own litter, without any sort of compunction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can at least be no apology for the
ferocity with which man in a state of civilisation,
pursues his fellow-creatures to the death, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ferocity!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain fiercely.
&ldquo;Who are so ferocious as philosophers?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The professor and the doctor uttered a simultaneous
exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of fellows the most ready
for fighting,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;filling the
veins of live animals with poison,&mdash;maiming
and torturing poor dumb creatures, in every
way ingenuity could devise, merely for the sake
of experiment; and then, after having indulged
themselves with the sight of such cruelty, sitting
down quietly to describe in the most minute
manner, the agonies they have inflicted? No,
it&rsquo;s only the philosopher does these things,&mdash;the
philosopher, who shudders at the idea of a
man killing those who seek to kill him, but
counts how many seconds an unoffending animal
is in dying, after having its brain scooped out,
or its heart torn from its breast. Scrunch me, if
I wouldn&rsquo;t at once be the man who kills whoever
opposes him, a thousand times, than such a cowardly,
calculating, inhuman miscreant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What the reply to these observations might
have been, it is impossible to say, as the party
were disturbed just at that moment by a knock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
at the cabin door, and entrance being given, in
walked the ungracious villain Scrumpydike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what news?&rdquo; inquired the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ship a fire, Sir,&rdquo; said the man, composedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ship on fire!&rdquo; loudly exclaimed all at
once, as they suddenly rose from their seats
with different degrees of alarm expressed on
their several countenances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes Sir, ship a fire, about half a mile off,&rdquo;
replied the sailor, looking as if he would have
laughed if he had dared at the consternation he
had created.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to observe the change which
took place on hearing the last announcement.
The idea of being roasted alive, would be sufficiently
terrible to scare the stoutest heart; and
on this occasion even the bold spirit of Oriel
Porphyry quailed at the sudden and frightful
danger. It is a mistake to imagine, that the
brave never feel an emotion of fear; dangers
that they have contemplated, may be met without
the slightest feeling of dread; but a new
danger, for which they are unprepared, is sure
to leave upon the bravest of the brave some impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of affright. The alarm, however, that
had been created was but momentary, and as
soon as it was erased, the whole party hastened
upon deck to observe the conflagration. Scrumpydike
had been left alone; so seeing the coast
clear, and the table covered with tempting
viands, he hastily proceeded to cram his mouth
with preserves and fruits; and was just raising a
bottle to his lips, to wash them down with a good
draught of exquisite wine, when he beheld in
the shadow of the room, what he thought to be,
two flaming eyes, fixed upon him, flashing
glances of scorn and indignation: the bottle
fell from his hands into a thousand pieces, his
forbidding features expressed the most intense
horror, and with a piercing yell he fled from
the room trembling with all the terrors of an
evil and superstitious nature, and leaving Zabra
more than usually gratified by the impression he
had made.</p>

<p>The night was dark as the grave. There was
no moon, and no stars. One immense cloud
hung over the broad surface of the ocean, like a
mighty pall, and the constant gusts of wind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
hurried with their melancholy voices through
the sails of the ship, might be supposed to be
the lament of nature at the funeral of the world.
The waters swept up to the vessel, like waves of
boiling pitch. The air was burthened with an
impenetrable gloom. An intense blackness enveloped
the whole untrackable length of way
over which the ship had passed. Looking back
from the vessel all was like the prospect of the
dead. Looking upward, it seemed as if the
eyes of heaven had been put out, and that a
deep and awful blindness had blasted the vision
of the universe. Save at a considerable distance
ahead, all was a chaos of darkness&mdash;a visible
nothingness&mdash;an infinite void; but when the
eye looked in that direction, flames appeared to
shoot out of the pitchy sea, licking the darkness,
and writhing, darting, twisting through the
smoke like serpents in the agonies of death. As
the light became stronger, part of the hull
and rigging of a ship could be discerned, and
hurrying to and fro, minute forms, readily discovered
to be human figures, became visible.
Now a shower of blazing sparks rushed as from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a volcano, up, up, high into the gloomy cloud,
piercing its black depths with their lurid beams,
and immediately the flame seemed dulled; a
moment after, they burst out again, with a fiercer
fury, and with a doubled volume; fragments
of burning timber were hurled into the air with
a giant&rsquo;s strength; flames red, blue, and yellow,
and vapours of every conceivable colour
from white to black, rose and fell, and mingled and
separated, like an army of many nations fighting
for mastery; and now that the whole extent of
the vessel was evidently one mass of resistless
fire, its fierce rays were reflected over the vast
surface of the surrounding ocean, making visible
dark figures, that looked like despairing men
struggling in the drowning waves, and scorching
rafters hissing and smoking around them.
Presently when the glare of light was at the
strongest, and the ship was seen blazing to the
water&rsquo;s edge, a sudden movement was observed,
the fire sunk into the wave beneath it,&mdash;a tall
column of thick grey smoke rose in its place,
and in a moment all was again swallowed up in
deep, utter, and boundless darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>It appeared as if the contemplation of this
spectacle had hitherto kept every one on board
the Albatross from any consideration for the
sufferers; but a suggestion having been made,
immediately each person seemed to exceed the
other in anxiety to render them assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burn a blue light at the mast head!&rdquo; exclaimed
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Sir,&rdquo; responded Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Set up every stitch of canvass she&rsquo;ll bear,&rdquo;
continued the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Sir,&rdquo; repeated the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put her machine to the fullest speed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Sir!&rdquo; was again the ready exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And bear right down upon the spot where
the flames were last seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment the deck, the sails, and rigging
were enveloped in a bright blue flame, that
gave the vessel and its crew the appearance of
the ship of death freighted with spectres; and
the Albatross was rushing through the waves
with the velocity of lightning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There seems great danger, while going at
such extraordinary speed, of passing over the
people who may have escaped from the burning
vessel, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;If they
can&rsquo;t keep a sharp look out it&rsquo;s their own fault;
and if they don&rsquo;t hail us when they see us, they
can&rsquo;t blame us for the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ship, ahoy! Starboard your helm!&rdquo; cried
a voice; and immediately a shriek of piercing
agony arose from under the ship&rsquo;s bows as the
swift vessel passed right over a large boat
crammed full of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ease her! Stop her!&rdquo; exclaimed a dozen
voices at once, as soon as the accident was discovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! I told you how &rsquo;t would be, don&rsquo;t
you see,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out with the galley and pick &rsquo;em up!&rdquo;
shouted Captain Compass, surlily; and the men
hastened to obey the command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take two or three blue lights with you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and stow them in the stern sheets,&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gently with her,&rdquo; cried Hearty, as he and
some of his messmates lowered the boat into the
sea, and the first who leapt into her was Oriel
Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, pull away!&rdquo; exclaimed the
young merchant, as he laid hold of an oar,
&ldquo;and you shall be rewarded for every man you
save.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sailors, however, wanted no such stimulus.
They exerted themselves bravely, and
were quickly in the midst of between twenty or
thirty swimmers, struggling in the waves and
shouting for assistance. The light in the boat
not only showed to the drowning men the near
approach of the aid they required, but directed
its crew to the places where they could be of
most service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; screamed one, with the water
gurgling in his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save me, or I sink!&rdquo; cried another, nearly
exhausted by his struggles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! here! here!&rdquo; shouted a dozen voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in different directions. Among the most active
in the rescue was Oriel Porphyry, who was so
fortunate as to save many who were on the
very point of sinking; and being well seconded,
with great difficulty and at considerable risk
they succeeded in hauling into their boat fifteen,
many of whom were more dead than alive;
but the rest they saw engulphed in the waters
before they could reach them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hollo!&rdquo; exclaimed Hearty, in a tone of
wonder and disappointment, as the crew were
about to return. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a vestige of the Albatross was visible,
and nothing was seen before or around them
but impenetrable darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I be food for fishes, if this arn&rsquo;t a
pleasant look out,&rdquo; observed Climberkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely they&rsquo;ll burn a light,&rdquo; said Oriel
Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve my misgivings on that &rsquo;ere head,&rdquo;
muttered Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how can we get back to the ship without?&rdquo;
inquired the merchant&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;d be no difficulty about that, Sir,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
here remarked Boggle, &ldquo;if we knowed her
whereabouts; but a man as is blind can&rsquo;t see,
and nobody can point out a thing in the dark
if they has no notion where it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a conjuror,&rdquo; replied Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not <em>quite</em> so clever as that, Sir,&rdquo;
rejoined the man. &ldquo;But I likes to have a
notion o&rsquo; things in general, as every man as is
a man, and thinks like a man, should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish, among your notions of things
in general, you could find one that will lead us
to the ship,&rdquo; said master Porphyry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like the idea of these poor fellows in their wet
jackets passing the night here, nor have I any
great desire for remaining here myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the worst we&rsquo;ve got to expect,
Sir,&rdquo; said Hearty; &ldquo;for if the ship holds on her
course, when we can see our way in the mornin&rsquo;,
she&rsquo;ll be far enough out o&rsquo; sight, and here we
shall be&mdash;nearly thirty on us&mdash;crammed together
in a open boat out at sea, where there&rsquo;s
no land within more nor five hundred miles on
us; without never a compass, or a bit o&rsquo; biscuit,
or a drop o&rsquo; water.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely, Captain Compass has forgotten we
cannot find our way back without seeing the
vessel,&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry, now beginning to
feel some anxiety for the fate of himself and his
associates. &ldquo;But we cannot be much above a
hundred yards from the ship. Shout as loud as
you can, and that will put them in mind of our
existence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahoy!&mdash;Ahoy!&mdash;Ahoy!&mdash;Hoy!&mdash;Hoy!
Oy!&rdquo; Every one who was able shouted as loud
as he could, and then waited in perfect silence
for a reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeho!&mdash;Yeho!&mdash;Yeho! Yho!&mdash;Ho!&mdash;O!&rdquo;
was replied by voices at a short distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some on &rsquo;em,&rdquo; exclaimed Hearty,
steering the boat towards the place from whence
the sounds came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hulloo! Hulloo! Ulloo! Loo! Oo!&rdquo;
was heard in another direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well if this arn&rsquo;t a most considerable cruel
puzzlement, I&rsquo;ll be transmogrified,&rdquo; observed
Boggle. The men again rested on their oars,
some with perplexity, others with superstitious
fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Albatross!&rdquo; cried they, joyfully,
all at once, as a blue flame was seen to
rise in the midst of the darkness, and disclose
the well-known figure of their beautiful vessel,
at rather more than a hundred yards from
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pull away, mates!&rdquo; shouted Hearty; and
the oarsmen, straining every muscle, soon
brought their boat alongside the ship.</p>

<br />
<span class="f8">PERILS OF EMIGRATION.</span></h2>


<p class="noi">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cheer</span> up, my dolphins!&rdquo; loudly exclaimed
Climberkin to the men rescued from drowning,
whom he and his shipmates were endeavouring
to make as comfortable as possible after their
fashion. &ldquo;Cheer up, and wet your gills with
this&mdash;precious sight better stuff nor salt
water, of which sort o&rsquo; liquidation I&rsquo;ve a notion
you were obligated last night to drink
more than was agreeable. Give us your fin,
my flying fish!&rdquo; he continued, as in the most
cordial manner he shook the hand of a fine
looking young man who sat near him. &ldquo;A
fellow don&rsquo;t deserve to be called a naval if he
ar&rsquo;nt a got no &rsquo;miseration for another fellow in
misfortune. So here&rsquo;s to &rsquo;ee&mdash;and may you
never have such tipple <em>above</em> your gills, and
all&rsquo;ays keep the salt water <em>under</em> your foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None on us &rsquo;a heard the &rsquo;ticulars o&rsquo; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
here deplorable &rsquo;flagration,&rdquo; said Hearty, &ldquo;and
if it arn&rsquo;t too unpleasant to &rsquo;municate, I should
like to hear the whole circumbendibus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps none of my comrades, now present,
are so well acquainted with the circumstances
of that unhappy affair as myself,&rdquo; remarked the
young man just alluded to; &ldquo;and if you will
allow me, I will not only relate to you all concerning
it that has come within my observation,
but combine the information with a narrative of
my own life that possibly may render it more
interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Consent having been readily and unanimously
given, the stranger proceeded to fulfil the intention
he had communicated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a native of Malthusia, an extensive
province far into the interior of Australia, where
my family, for many generations, had owned
a small estate; but as the difficulty of living in
any state approaching comfort, in a densely populated
country, where consumption exceeds
supply, and the price of labour is reduced to
limits within which life can scarcely be supported,
in consequence of the constant pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of competition, produced by the supply greatly
exceeding the demand, became so great, it was
considered amongst us whether it would not be
the most advantageous thing that could be done
under the circumstances, to leave a land where
we could not exist with the same respectability
in which our fathers had lived, and seek our
fortunes in a new country, where the means of
subsistence were more easily procured, and the
results of labour more profitable to the industrious.
The idea was debated long and frequently
before it was resolved upon. Children of the
soil, whose most pleasurable associations were
connected with the land on which we had been
born, it could not be expected that we could
easily tear asunder the loving ties that connected
us to our ancient home. My father was
getting into the vale of life, but possessed much
of the strength of man in his vigour; and myself
and five other brothers were strong and
active, ingenious, laborious, and persevering.
We were considered the very persons for whom
emigration would be most advantageous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, besides the natural disinclination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
leave the scene of every pleasure I had known,
I had a still stronger repugnance, which I found
it impossible to remove. May I claim your
indulgence, while I speak of one who made my
native earth and sky a paradise of delights. She,
of whom I speak, Optima, the fair, the kind, the
good, by the sweetness of her disposition and
the excellence of her behaviour, created in me
that perfect sympathy, which greater personal
attractions and a less amount of moral advantages,
would have failed to have produced in a
nature like mine. From having lived in each
other&rsquo;s society from childhood, and our fortunes
and prospects being as nearly as possible
alike, we had mutually indulged in the same
fond hopes of an undivided existence, and in
our quiet walks by the hill side, and by the
margin of the soft flowing stream, and in the
long delightful rests we took beneath the shadow
of the friendly trees, our little ambition was
pictured in rosy colours, and the landscape of
our future seemed to glow with sunshine, gladness,
and beauty. At this time, having suddenly
been made an orphan, Optima became dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
upon an old querulous aunt, who having
saved a little property in the course of a long
life, which she designed for her niece, was desirous
that she should marry some one of still
more ample means; and opposed our union
with all the despotism she could exercise: but
we managed to meet as usual, though not quite
so frequently. Notwithstanding the efforts made
to keep us asunder, and although in consequence
of the gratitude she felt towards her relative for
the protection she had received, she would not
listen to my wishes for an immediate union, for
the purpose of joining the intended emigrants,
she bade me hope for better times, and assured
me, with all the fervour of her guileless spirit,
that her affection must endure with her existence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Preparations were now made for the departure
of my family for their destination to a
flourishing colony on the European continent,
but I finding it impossible to quit the scene that
held all that was dear to me, resolved to remain
in Australia, supporting myself by the application
of an unceasing industry, till in company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with my adored Optima, I could join them in
their new home. My brothers did not seem to
approve of my resolution, and endeavoured
to induce me to change it; but my father, who
had more knowledge of human nature, understood
my motives, and left me to follow my own
inclinations. I busied myself in assisting in
their arrangements, but I found my feelings far
more active than my endeavours. I strived to
shut out from my mind all idea of the loneliness
in which I must live after the departure of my
family, and sought to banish the fear I sometimes
experienced, that as then the difficulty of
seeing Optima would be increased, some unfortunate
accident would render our union impossible.
Our interviews now became exceedingly
painful, my entreaties grew more urgent, my
dread of the consequences of her refusal more
intense; but she only answered me with tears;
and at last, as the time drew near for quitting
Malthusia, our hearts became too full for utterance,
and our congratulations at meeting, and
sorrows at parting, were alike silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ardent!&rsquo; said she to me on one occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
after we had sat together a long time without
daring to speak, &rsquo;you must not think me unkind
by thus seeming to oppose your happiness.
I do a violence to my own feelings, indeed I do,
Ardent, whenever I refuse your solicitations.&rsquo;&mdash;Her
sobs for some time prevented her proceeding;
at last she continued;&mdash;&lsquo;But I should
be selfish, were I to allow myself to do as you
would have me, and act with a regardlessness of
your interests, for which I should never be able
to forgive myself. My aunt, it is evident to all
who see her, is rapidly approaching her dissolution.
She has been kind to me. I wish not
her last moments to be rendered miserable, by
what in me would appear to her ingratitude,
and I am most anxious for your sake, dear Ardent,
that she should not, through any imprudence
of mine, annul those intentions in my
favour she has so frequently expressed. Her
property is but small, but it will enable us to
join your family, and with industry and economy
may produce for us a greater degree of comfort
than without it we can hope to obtain.
Wait, Ardent; the time is not propitious now;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
but if we are not impatient of our happiness, we
shall soon be as happy as we can desire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pressed her more closely to my breast&mdash;I
blessed her in my heart, but my voice
seemed to have lost all power of expressing my
emotions; no longer I made use of entreaties.
I was grateful, and resigned. The day came on
which the emigrants were to leave the seat of all
their past enjoyments. My brothers appeared
careless of quitting the land of their fathers.
They were hard working, hard thinking men,
who valued nothing except for its utility, and
looked upon the affection with which memory
regards the scenes of its pleasures, as romantic
nonsense, only fit to delight children. But my
father could not so readily get rid of the impressions
he had cherished from his infancy; with
him the departure from his home seemed a banishment
from his happiness. He visited the
lands his forefathers had owned, but which had
long passed from their descendants. He walked
in the fields he had ploughed and drilled and
harrowed since he was a boy, and he looked upon
the trees he had planted, and the buildings he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
had raised, as if he was taking a last farewell of
a company of ancient friends. As he approached
the cemetery in which lay the bones of his ancestors,
his manly form seemed to lose half its
strength&mdash;his ruddy cheek grew pale&mdash;his
step became feeble, his eye dim, and his heart
faint; and as he bared his head that the cool
breeze might fan the thin white hairs that played
about his forehead, he was obliged to lean
against a monument to support his sinking form.
Here rested in peace the wife of his bosom and
the mother of his children; and he felt as if he
was about to desert her remains to be trampled
on by strangers. He thought of where <em>his</em> grave
would be, and in the agony of his heart lamented
that two who had never been divided in
life should in death be placed so far apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I witnessed the sale of the land and stock;
I assisted in packing up the moveables; I was
present when the neighbours came to bid farewell,
and to express their honest regrets; and
after having beheld my family turn their backs
upon the habitation of their race, I hastened to
Optima, with the design of enjoying her sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
presence for the last time, until I had parted
with my father and my brothers at the nearest
sea-port. I came to the house of her relative
and found it closed. Having with some difficulty
gained admittance, Optima rushed into
my arms, and wept upon my breast. It was not
till a considerable time had elapsed, that I ascertained
what was the cause of her grief. Her
aunt had died the night previous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a lapse of a few weeks Optima became
mine. On the day of our marriage she
placed a packet in my hands, and speaking in a
voice broken with emotion, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have a favour to ask you, and I know on
such a day as this you cannot deny me. Take
this, dear Ardent, and make whatever use of it
you think proper. Your heart is yearning to
join your relatives; be assured that wherever
you wish to go I desire to follow. I cannot be
happy but where your happiness may be best
secured. I am indifferent to country and to
kindred,&mdash;I can acknowledge no relative but a
husband, and can know of no country except
that in which I find his home. Whenever your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
preparations are made, dear Ardent, I am
ready.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I kissed off the tears that were trembling
on her eyelids, and in brief but eloquent
language expressed the love with which my
heart was overflowing. The packet contained
a sum of money amply sufficient for our purposes.
Having by letter previously apprised my
family of these circumstances, they delayed their
departure; and after providing every thing that
was necessary for the wants of agricultural emigrants,
we all set sail from the populous seaport
Kangarootown, in a magnificent ship fitted
up in the most splendid manner, and carrying
more than three hundred passengers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No!&rsquo; exclaimed half a dozen anxious
listeners, starting up with horror and surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true!&rdquo; replied the young man, in a
voice scarcely audible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord ha&rsquo; mercy on their miserable
souls!&rdquo; said Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had not been many days out at sea,&rdquo;
continued the narrator, &ldquo;and were busily and
cheerfully employed in forming plans for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
future, when one evening, as soon as we had
all retired to our berths, the gas with which
the interior of the ship was lighted, through some
carelessness had been suffered to escape, and it
having caught fire, the first alarm the passengers
received was from finding themselves surrounded
by flames. There were but two or three boats
belonging to the vessel, to which there was
immediately a general rush. Without waiting
to secure any of my property, I instantly hurried
on deck with Optima, and was so fortunate
as to secure her and myself a place in the
largest boat. I shouted to my father and my
brothers to join us, but as soon as we were full
the rope was cut, and we pulled from the burning
ship with all the strength of desperate men.
As the flames rose up into the rigging we could
see hundreds running backwards and forwards,
bewildered and stupified by fear. One after
another jumped into the remaining boats, into
which they crowded so rapidly that their own
weight at once sunk them to the bottom.
Others in their frenzy leapt into the sea&mdash;the
rest retreated from the flames as they
advanced, shrieking their own knell, till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
fire beginning to scorch their flesh they fell
over into the waves, or letting go their grasp of
the ropes up which they had climbed, sunk
yelling with agony into the midst of the raging
fire. I saw nothing of my brothers. I imagine
they perished in the smaller boats. But
while observing the destruction of the ship, I beheld,
high up the tallest mast, the figure of an old
man&mdash;his white hair scorched upon his brows&mdash;his
blood-shot eyes bursting from their
sockets&mdash;his trembling limbs clinging to the
rigging, screaming for mercy and for help. I
knew the form&mdash;the voice pierced my brain.
I would have leapt into the sea with the wild
but fruitless hope of hastening to his rescue,
but I was forcibly held to my seat; and Optima,
who had not changed her position since I
placed her in the boat, with her face upon my
breast and her arms round my neck, clung to
me trembling with terror. In a moment afterwards
the flaming vessel disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could scarcely congratulate ourselves
upon our safety, for although we had escaped
being burnt to death, there seemed but little
hope of our being saved from drowning, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
from starvation. There were thirty of us
closely packed together, not one of whom knew
exactly how far we were from land; few were
clothed, and none had either provisions or
water. My feelings were of the most agonising
description. I had seen my family perish before
my eyes without having the ability to render
them the slightest assistance&mdash;all their property
and mine&mdash;all that the loving kindness
of Optima had enabled me to procure for our
future wants, were swallowed up in the devouring
fire, and now I was left with her
upon the boundless ocean enjoying no other
hope than that we should perish together.
Bitter as my reflections were, they grew almost
insupportable when I considered with what a
dreadful fate the devotion of her I loved would
be rewarded. But she whose goodness had
been thus cruelly turned to evil seemed to
think of nothing, and care for nothing, but for
him to whom she clung. At this instant when
we were giving ourselves up to despair, a light
blazing from your ship proclaimed to us the
joyful intelligence that assistance was at hand.
Then what a change came upon us. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
murmurs of complaint were turned to the
loud shouts of gladness; and so completely did
we enter into the spirit of the moment, that
none noticed the rapid approach of the ship
coming to our relief, till she was just upon us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are saved, dearest!&rdquo; I whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Optima unclasped her arms, and took one
of my hands in hers. Then came the overwhelming
crush of the great ship&mdash;a shout&mdash;a
scream&mdash;and her keel passed over us. The
shock came so unexpected that none had time
to think of the danger, and we were gasping
and struggling in the water before we were
aware of the accident. I made a snatch at
what I thought was the sinking form of Optima,
but soon I found out the dreadful mistake. It
was a strong man, who being no swimmer
caught hold of my limbs with a desperate grasp
that nothing but death could relax. In vain I
strove to shake him off&mdash;I struggled&mdash;I fought&mdash;I
kicked in vain. He held me as a serpent
holds its prey. The thought of my beloved
sinking into the bowels of the great deep,
deserted by him whose happiness she had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
striven to secure, nerved my arms with a giant&rsquo;s
strength, and catching the drowning wretch by
the throat, I squeezed the breath out of his
miserable body, hurled him from me as if he
had been a loathsome reptile, and then struck
out into the sea, swimming in various directions,
shouting her name in every tone of agony&mdash;plunging,
diving, and beating the waters with
the fierce energy of a madman. My heart sunk
within me&mdash;my strength was exhausted. I
felt the terrible conviction, that for me there
was no hope&mdash;and resigned myself to the cold
embraces of the relentless wave. Of what
afterwards occurred I know not, till I found
myself on board the Albatross, recovered from
the jaws of death by the kind and unceasing
attention of her friendly crew. But do not
think me ungrateful, when, reflecting upon the
dreadful loss I have endured, and the wretched
fate to which I have been left, I express a
regret that my life has been spared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scrunch me, if I ar&rsquo;nt springing a leak as
no pump can stop!&rdquo; exclaimed Climberkin, as
soon as the stranger had concluded his narrative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
as he wiped with his knuckles the big tears out
of the corners of his eyes;&mdash;an example which
was followed by many of his shipmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I go to sea in a cockle shell, if ever I
heard o&rsquo; any thin&rsquo; so cruel molloncholy,&rdquo; said
Boggle; &ldquo;my eyes are like sieves catching a
thunder shower. But a fellow who can listen to
such a tarnation heart-twister as this here without
runnin&rsquo; out like a water spout, must have
the soul o&rsquo; a nigger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soul ob a nigger!&rdquo; exclaimed the fat cook,
furiously, while the drops that ran down his
black cheeks evinced his sympathy for the sufferings
he had heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soul ob a nigger!&mdash;What da debble you
mean, you fellar! Tink a nigger no heart&mdash;tink
him hab no sensebillity, you fellar?&rdquo; Then
turning to the stranger, he said, as well as his
sobs would allow, &ldquo;Roly Poly berry much feel
for you Sar, oo, oo!&mdash;Hard ting to lose him
missee, Sar, oo, oo!&mdash;Roly Poly in lub himself
once, Sar.&mdash;Lubly cretur too, oo, oo!&mdash;She
had de dropsy, Sar.&mdash;Doctor nebber make her
no better, so she turn her nose against de wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and die like a lamb, oo, oo, oo!&rdquo; And away
the poor fellow went, sobbing as if his heart
would break.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whip me into eel skins, if I sees the
fun o&rsquo; givin&rsquo; a fellow the miserables!&rdquo; exclaimed
Scrumpydike, gulping down a deep draught of
the liquor before him; &ldquo;I seed many a sight
worser nor what you&rsquo;ve been telling on us,
mister,&mdash;and ar&rsquo;nt a thought it worth while to
say nothin&rsquo; to nobody about it. There ar&rsquo;nt no
sort o&rsquo; life as produces so many wonderfuls as
that o&rsquo; a free mariner. Once upon a time I was
taken prisoner with some other chaps, and kept
aboard one o&rsquo; them darin&rsquo; crafts what goes bang
at any thin&rsquo; as comes in their track&mdash;and I
seed sich jollifications&mdash;sich junkettings&mdash;sich
cargoes o&rsquo; grog&mdash;and sich chests o&rsquo; money, as
I never had afore a wink o&rsquo; a notion on. There
they were, dancin&rsquo; and singin&rsquo;, and rollin&rsquo; in
riches&mdash;caring for nobody&mdash;doing whatever
they had a mind&mdash;every one o&rsquo; the crew a
cap&rsquo;ain, and the cap&rsquo;ain a prince; and whenever
they had a brush, which was as often as
they fell in with anythin&rsquo; worth havin&rsquo;, at it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
they went, harem scarem&mdash;carryin&rsquo; every thin&rsquo;
afore &rsquo;em&mdash;cuttin&rsquo; down and blowin&rsquo; up, and
sinkin&rsquo; or seizin&rsquo; the richest ships as sailed in
them seas. Scrunch me, if they did&rsquo;nt seem as
happy as periwinkles on a rock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; observed Boggle; &ldquo;and I ar&rsquo;nt
afeard to say, as many a honest naval would
become a free mariner, if he had&rsquo;nt the gumption
to reccomember he was consiserable sure o&rsquo;
a sartainty o&rsquo; being hanged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either hanged or drowned, or spiflicated in
some other unnat&rsquo;ral manner,&rdquo; added Hearty;
&ldquo;and not without desarvin&rsquo; on &rsquo;t. None o&rsquo; sich
scum ever died in a honest fashion. Now in
the course o&rsquo; my sperience, I knowed a smartish
lot consarnin&rsquo; the notorious sea-sharks, Cap&rsquo;ain
Death and his Lef&rsquo;tenant Rifle, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know &rsquo;em?&rdquo; inquired Scrumpydike,
eagerly, fixing a searching look upon the
old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I did&rsquo;nt exactly know &rsquo;em, but I
knowed a good deal <em>on</em> &rsquo;em; and if ever I comes
upon their tack, with a few other honest chaps
as knows how to give and take, if I don&rsquo;t leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
my mark on some o&rsquo; their figure-heads, I ha&rsquo;
lost all notion o&rsquo; hand-writing;&rdquo; said Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you may chance to come alongside on
&rsquo;em afore you&rsquo;re aware, and then you&rsquo;d best
look out for squalls, old boy;&rdquo; observed the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ar&rsquo;nt afeard o&rsquo; that. But as I was a
sayin&rsquo;, these here varmint were &rsquo;sociated wi&rsquo; a
gang o&rsquo; similar bloody-minded villains, and in a
well armed craft which they&rsquo;d got hold on, by
no partic&rsquo;lar honesty I&rsquo;ll be bound, they went a
robbin&rsquo; and plund&rsquo;rin, and burnin&rsquo; and massacr&rsquo;in&rsquo;,
every ship as they came anigh, till at
last flesh and blood couldn&rsquo;t stand any sich
howdacity&mdash;so two or three smartish vessels,
full o&rsquo; chaps o&rsquo; the right sort, steered into their
haunts, and there they kept cruising about
in hopes o&rsquo; coming to close quarters. But somehow
or other they hadn&rsquo;t no sich luck. At
last, when they began to calc&rsquo;late as Cap&rsquo;ain
Death had given them the slip, one o&rsquo; the ships
diskivered a strange sail&mdash;and she was narrowly
watched, hoping she might prove to contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the &rsquo;dentical set o&rsquo; murd&rsquo;rin&rsquo; vagabonds
they was arter. Suspicions becoming pretty
strong, signals were made to her consorts to
take a long sweep, so as to circumvent the villains
so reg&rsquo;larly as they couldn&rsquo;t escape no
how. But that &rsquo;ere Cap&rsquo;ain Death was no
goslin&rsquo;. He seed the canouvres they was a
going about, hung out ev&rsquo;ry bit o&rsquo; canvass he
could carry, and cut his precious stick like
winkin! Howsomdever, he war&rsquo;nt awake to
the movement till they came rollin&rsquo; up to him
in a manner quite lovely to look on; and then
they showed that they was as good hands at
followin&rsquo; as he was at runnin&rsquo; away. The chase
was carried on for a matter o&rsquo; six hours, in sich
a style as made him look behind oftener than he
looked afore; and for all he went on this tack,
and on t&rsquo;other tack, and tried all sorts o&rsquo; games
to get out o&rsquo; the way, they came so near as to
be able to give him a pretty considerable taste
o&rsquo; their quality. Well, as night began to set in,
there came on one o&rsquo; the most thund&rsquo;rin&rsquo; storms
as ever was&mdash;the wind blowed away as if it
would shiver its own bellows into saw-dust, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the sea came up mountains high, in a manner it
was more grand than pleasant to look on. The
vessels in chase, finding themselves close upon
an ugly sort of a coast, were obligated to keep
out at sea as much as possible; but they endeavoured
to keep such a look out as would
prevent the villains from making themselves
scarce afore morning. Well, when the mornin&rsquo;
broke all as clear as if there&rsquo;d never been no
rumpus&mdash;our ship&mdash;for, mind ye, I volunteered
a purpose to have a rap at some on &rsquo;em&mdash;our
ship and her consorts, who&rsquo;d rode out the gale
with nothin&rsquo; but the loss o&rsquo; a few spars, approached
the shore for the purpose o&rsquo; making
secure o&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;ain Death, but the very first thing
they clapped their blessed eyes on, was the ship
they&rsquo;d been in chase lyin&rsquo; a perfect wreck among
the breakers, making it a right down positive
stark staring fact that every mother&rsquo;s son o&rsquo; the
gallows birds that belonged to her were feeding
the crabs and lobsters, and sich like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they were all drowned!&rdquo; said Climberkin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;s been heard o&rsquo; any on &rsquo;em from
that day to this;&rdquo; replied Hearty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But war&rsquo;nt there a sort o&rsquo; song which &rsquo;twas
said the crew of the ship used to sing?&rdquo; enquired
Climberkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure there was,&rdquo; cried Scrumpydike,
who had for some time looked more gloomy
than usual; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it many&rsquo;s a time; and
if you&rsquo;ve a mind to listen, though I ar&rsquo;nt no
great shakes o&rsquo; a singing bird, I&rsquo;ll give you the
only original version as used to be sung by the
free mariners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear none o&rsquo; such villainous
ditties!&rdquo; exclaimed Hearty, as he left the
circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who axed you, old Snapdragon?&rdquo; responded
the other, and presently with more animation
than music, sung the following words:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_VI" id="CHAP_VI">CHAP. VI.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">APPEARANCE OF THE AFRICAN COAST.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Zabra</span> had by this time become more familiar
to the people of the Albatross, with some of
whom his kindness and generosity made him an
especial favourite. They had ceased to see any
thing supernatural in his large lustrous eyes,&mdash;and
had forgot that there was any thing mysterious
in the dark colour of his complexion. His
solitary wanderings about the ship created neither
fear nor surprise, and the rich harmonies of his
music were listened to with much more admiration
than dread. Loop, a boy belonging to the
vessel, who was a sister&rsquo;s son of Hearty, had
been attacked with fever, and the attentions of
Zabra, during his illness, won not only the heart
of the old man, but that of every one on board.
He procured for him every kind of nourishing
food and refreshing beverage, that the Doctor
would allow; took care that he should possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
every comfort that the vessel contained; sung
to him, played to him, and stayed beside his
hammock for hours and hours, seeking to while
away the tedious moments of indisposition.
Oriel Porphyry having desired that he should
be treated by every one as if he was his brother,
instead of his attendant, Zabra found his
slightest request always promptly attended to;
and, though his manner was somewhat proud,
as he seemed to possess abundant funds for every
purpose, and gave liberally whenever he thought
it was requisite, scarcely any one in the ship
ever hesitated in joining in his praise.</p>

<p>The boy Loop got well, and he was not ungrateful.
As for old Hearty, nothing could exceed
his devotion to his nephew&rsquo;s benefactor.
To every listener he could lay hold of, he narrated
at length all that he knew of the youth&rsquo;s
history, since he came on board: the people,
rescued from the fire-ship, were in due time
made familiar with every anecdote concerning
him with which the old man was acquainted;
and to no one were his details of more interest
than to the young Australian, Ardent, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
sometimes appeared to forget his own sorrows
while attentive to the unpolished eloquence of
the honest sailor. From this time Zabra became
an object of general interest. Even Captain
Compass seemed to look upon him with
something like respect; Scrumpydike had ceased
to entertain against him any hostile intentions;
and Log, the captain&rsquo;s clerk, was heard to acquiesce
in the opinion of his shipmates, with an
affirmative repeated with the usual supply of
adjectives.</p>

<p>But to Oriel Porphyry the admirable qualities
of his page became every day more and
more apparent. In the frequent conversations
that took place between them, he could not but
observe the developement of a mind of the
highest order. It was not a mind impregnated
with the heavy spirit of bookish learning, but
an intelligence of a lighter, a more graceful, and
a more original nature, replete with a sweet
sympathy, and a lofty enthusiasm for all that
was noble, good and beautiful; and throwing
over the youthful figure and handsome countenance
of its possessor, a poetical and romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
character, that was both a wonder and a charm
to his companion. Zabra spoke of Eureka as if
he had become acquainted with her most hidden
thoughts, and had been constituted their interpreter;
but of himself he never spoke. When
Oriel seemed desirous of learning something of
his history, he appeared uneasy, and immediately
attempted to turn the conversation into
another channel. This was noticed; but the
unwillingness of the young Creole to speak of
himself, Oriel attributed to the disinclination
usually shown by natural children to allude to
their own illegitimacy, knowing the unreasonable
and cruel prejudices of society: therefore
he ceased to desire from him any information on
the subject. Still, his youth,&mdash;the singular
beauty of his countenance, and the strange interest
it often expressed, made him imagine that
there was some mystery connected with him.</p>

<p>As he treated Zabra with the utmost confidence,
and appreciated the intelligence he
evinced, Oriel Porphyry communicated to him
the contents of his father&rsquo;s letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father is a noble character,&rdquo; he exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
with fervour; &ldquo;and the proudest title
of which you ought to boast, is that of being his
son. I never could have supposed that it was
possible for such nobility to reside in a spirit
devoted to the mere money-getting purposes of
traffic, but I have been educated in an aristocratic
school, and with its lofty principles I
have imbibed some of its illiberal prejudices. I
would <em>my</em> father had been such a one&mdash;I should
not have been the fugitive I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Express no regrets, Zabra. Let it be my
pleasing task to see that your fortunes are worthy
of your merits;&rdquo; said Oriel Porphyry, affectionately
taking in his the hand of his youthful
companion. &ldquo;And although I have not much
reason to think well of the proud Philadelphia,
for his conduct has not been such as would be
likely to inspire me either with affection or respect;
when I think of his relationship to her
whose genuine worth it is impossible not to appreciate,
I cannot regard the unfavourableness
of his disposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eureka is not unmindful of your kind feelings
towards her;&rdquo; observed the other in a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
tremulous voice than he had hitherto used. &ldquo;It
is her desire to deserve your affections, that has
supported her under many trials. Her father
is proud, but not so proud as Eureka. Yet
there is an impassable gulf between the pride of
the two. He would sacrifice every one around
him for the immediate gratification of his own
self-love: she would sacrifice all selfish considerations
that interfered with the happiness of
one she loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And think you I cannot honour such goodness
in the manner it deserves?&rdquo; asked the
merchant&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Let him be what he will&mdash;let
his pride be as mean, and his ambition as
selfish as it may, for the sake of Eureka I will
endeavour to forget his unworthiness. All I
hope is, that he will not attempt to force her
inclinations to an alliance more pleasing to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cannot force her inclinations&mdash;that he
knows;&rdquo; remarked Zabra. &ldquo;He has made the
attempt for the first and last time; and Eureka
is now beyond his reach.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel with astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He thought the more
completely to secure your separation from her,
to hurry her into a marriage with the wealthy and
powerful head of the princely house of Vermont;
but the character of such a man, had no other
obstacle existed, would have been sufficient to
have produced in her feelings a repugnance
which nothing could overpower. As it was, she
indignantly refused to become a sacrifice to her
father&rsquo;s ambition. Her sentiments, however, on
the subject, were so little regarded by him, that
he made preparations to compel her to the
union.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed master Porphyry, &ldquo;I
could not have imagined such despotism in a
parent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Closely as she was watched,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;Eureka managed to escape from her confinement;
and when she sent me to be the companion
of your fortunes, she had secured for
herself the asylum she required.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is she? Let me hasten to afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
her the protection of which she must be so much
in want!&rdquo; exclaimed the impetuous Oriel; then
reproachfully added, &ldquo;Why, why did you not
tell me this before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have obeyed my instructions;&rdquo; replied
the youth calmly. &ldquo;It is sufficient for you to
know that now she is safe, and that she is in the
enjoyment of as much happiness as it is possible
for her to obtain under the circumstances. Her
retreat can only be made known to you when all
the purposes of the present voyage are completed,
and you return to Columbus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can I not communicate with her? will
she not write to me?&rdquo; eagerly inquired the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be satisfied that it is impossible she should
forget you, and endeavour to prove to her without
the aids of continual correspondence, that in
your affection the same durability exists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will! I will!&rdquo; cried Oriel; &ldquo;I will do all
she would have me. I will follow the plan my
father has laid out, even to the minutest details;
will try to find patience for its endurance by
thinking of the blissful result with which it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
be crowned. We are now approaching the
southern coast of Africa,&rdquo; he continued after a
pause of some duration, which neither had attempted
to interrupt; &ldquo;and my immediate destination
Caffreton, the great mart of traffic in
this part of the world is the first point of my
commercial voyage. My father has written me
very full instructions which I have carefully
studied, and you will shortly see, Zabra, how
well I shall be able to play the merchant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had been standing together on the
deck gazing upon the world of waters before
them during the preceding dialogue, and were
now silently observing the progress of some
distant vessels, when they were joined by the
learned Professor Fortyfolios. Addressing
Oriel, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That portion of land you observe yonder,
rising out of the sea, is an important Cape, well
known in the annals of navigation, and was
called by the ancients the Cape of Good Hope.
It used to be celebrated for producing an inferior
wine, called Cape Wine, which being
cheap, as it was worthless, was brought in considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
quantities for the purpose either of
adulterating wines of a higher value, or was
palmed upon the ignorant as the produce of a
different vintage. The English, a people with
whose history you are doubtless familiar, though
not wine growers, were the greatest wine consumers
of that period, and it was the immense
demand for this necessary of life among that
people, which the wines of Spain, Portugal,
Sicily, Italy, France, Germany, and other
countries, could not sufficiently supply, that
brought this Cape into notice. The African
wines are now remarkable for their admirable
qualities. That it was the search after new
liquors that sent the English into this part of
the world chroniclers are not agreed, and that
there were other wines produced in the same
locality much superior in flavour, I think is
more than probable, because I have found in
the course of my reading, eloquent commendation
of an African wine, called Constantia, and
I have good reason for imagining that the
deserts which the first voyagers of that nation
met with on some portions of the coast, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
they ascertained that a superior liquor was
here procurable, originated the English proverb
&lsquo;Good wine needs no bush.&rsquo; However, there
can be no doubt that the English planted a
colony at this very Cape; gradually drove the
natives from their land as they increased in
power and numbers, till the whole continent
from the Cape of Good Hope to Alexandria,
and from Abyssinia to Senegambia, acknowledged
their sway, and, in a great measure,
spoke their language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, those English were a great people!&rdquo;
remarked Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were so,&rdquo; said the Professor; &ldquo;when
we consider what they did, and the means they
had to do it, we must acknowledge that they
deserve the epithet, &lsquo;great.&rsquo; At an early period
of the world&rsquo;s history, England was utterly unknown.
In the times of Assyrian greatness,
in the eras of Babylon, of Jerusalem, and of
Troy&mdash;and in the more brilliant ages of the
Greeks, the Romans, and the Carthaginians,
such an island had never been heard of&mdash;scarcely
two thousand years had elapsed before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
this speck upon the waters became the most
powerful kingdom upon the earth. She had
possessions in every quarter of the globe; her
conquering armies had penetrated into the
remotest regions, and her gallant navies had
triumphed in every sea. She had given a new
people and a new language to the vast continent
of America; she had founded a new division
of the world in Australia; she had been
acknowledged the mistress of the mighty Indies;
she had forced a path through deserts of
perpetual ice, and found a home in the scorching
heat of the torrid zone. And by this time
what had become of the nations of a more
remote antiquity? Of some, the localities were
not to be traced; others remained a heap of
stones. The Carthaginians were extinct&mdash;the
free and noble Greeks had become slaves or
pirates&mdash;and the daring Romans, who boasted
having conquered the world, were an ignoble
emasculated race, confined to a single city and
its suburbs, and governed by a despotic old
woman in the shape of a priest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The form of government under which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
people of this continent exists, is republican, I
believe;&rdquo; observed Master Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole is divided into a multitude of
republics, some of which are always at war with
one another,&rdquo; replied his tutor; &ldquo;and they
show their idea of liberty, of which they make
the most preposterous boast, by keeping up a
system of slavery the most tyrannical and revolting
that can be imagined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Compass,
coming up and joining in the conversation;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the way of the world. Hear your most
famous spouter about the blessings of freedom
and all that sort of thing, and ten to one if
you don&rsquo;t find him ready to domineer over
every body beneath him. When I hear a
fellow mighty fine in his notions of universal
liberty, I always feel pretty certain that he
only wants the power to trample on the independence
of all who might stand in the way
of his particular enjoyments. But this is all
natural enough; the feeble are monstrously
indignant at the exercise of power in the hands
of their rulers; but when by any accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
they become powerful, they all at once see the
advantages of keeping down those who are
down, and in a very short time become just
as despotic as those of whom they complained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What vessels are these, Captain?&rdquo; inquired
Oriel, pointing to several ships, appearing at
different distances in the open sea before them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yonder vessel, whose tall masts are bending
before the brisk breeze that fills her sails,
is an Algerine merchantman, and has most
probably a cargo of dancing masters, cooks,
figurantes, and opera singers, which are as much
now the chief produce of the people to whom
she belongs, as they were a thousand years ago
the principal exports of their progenitors.
That sombre thing, with the long funnel in the
centre of her deck, is very similar to the
steamers of which the ancients were so proud,
before an improved propelling power was discovered.
She belongs to the Abyssinians&mdash;a
people remarkably slow in adopting the inventions
of their more civilised neighbours; she
trades from the sea of Babel Mandeb to the
Gulph of Guinea, sometimes touching at Madagascar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and the neighbouring islands, and carries
passengers, pigs, crockery, and snuff. This
rakish looking craft, flying afore the wind like
a petrel in a storm, is a free trader with a
rich cargo of smuggled merchandise from the
continent to the Mauritius; and the big ship
yonder, bearing down upon us as if she&rsquo;d sink
every thing that stood in her way, is a man of
war belonging to the Liberians&mdash;a powerful
nation of blacks. All these small fry that are
starting up from every point, are merely coasting
vessels&mdash;government packets,&mdash;fishing
smacks&mdash;pilot boats,&mdash;pleasure yachts, and
other floaters of a similar nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is this?&rdquo; inquired Oriel, pointing
to something of a very strange appearance
that was seen at the distance of about three
quarters of a mile, making way at a rapid rate
towards the shore. They all gazed in that
direction, and a most extraordinary spectacle
they beheld. At first it seemed like a ball&mdash;but
as it approached the ship it enlarged, and
every one who saw it knew it to be a balloon.
How it came there, floating on the waves by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
itself, many conjectured; but their surprise at
its appearance was wonderfully increased, when
they observed a man, with his body immersed
in the waves, clinging to it, or more probably
attached to its fastenings. His peril he endeavoured
to make known by screams of the
most piercing description; but it was not till
the miserable wretch was being rapidly borne
past their vessel that the people of the Albatross
discovered the full extent of his danger. For
at least half a mile behind him the sea was a
mass of white smoking foam, which was created
by nearly a hundred immense sharks following
him with eager speed, lashing the waves with
their tails, leaping over each other, plunging,
snorting, and displaying the most ravenous
desire to catch him in their enormous jaws.
Sometimes the balloon ascended a little distance
above the sea and then would rapidly descend,
plunging the unhappy aeronaut over his head in
the salt water; but while the sharks were all
striving against each other to make a mouthful
of his limbs, it would again ascend, floating
swiftly over the surface, bearing its screaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
appendant about a foot above his unrelenting
pursuers, who continued to follow him struggling
furiously with each other, and eagerly snapping at
his limbs whenever they approached the surface
of the water. It was impossible to render him
any assistance, although he passed within a few
yards of the ship, he was carried so swiftly
along; and on he went, shrieking with agony,
now high above the waves&mdash;then dashed in
beneath them&mdash;then flying over the surface,
with the horrid expectation of being immediately
devoured by the hungry pack by whom
he was pursued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scrunch me, if that isn&rsquo;t the most cruel
chase I ever saw,&rdquo; exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These sort of accidents are not at all extraordinary,&rdquo;
observed Fortyfolios, &ldquo;and with
such things must frequently occur. Balloons
are an old invention, and one the least useful
for philosophical purposes of any we have received
from the ancients. Attempts have been
made, attended with success, to get one or several
individuals borne by them from an island
to an adjoining continent, and from one part of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
continent to a part far remote; but as they have
found it impossible to control the current of wind
met with in certain elevations, and as they can
seldom rely upon a current in any one direction
lasting for any length of time, they have been
able to rise as high as they please, but can never
previously fix exactly upon the place of their
descent; and it has in many instances occurred,
as in the one we have just now observed, that
after the aeronaut has made his ascent, a sudden
wind takes him in a direction contrary to what
he designed, or various currents rising unexpectedly
at nearly the same time, he is shifted
about to every point of the compass; and when
he is obliged to descend, he finds himself floating
over some unknown sea, or some wild uncultivated
land, hundreds of miles from human
assistance, where he is left to endure the conviction
that he must either be drowned or
starved. A balloon is, in fact, a toy, with which
one fool amuses many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing more was said on the subject, although
the dangerous situation of the poor fellow
who had attached himself to the balloon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was anxiously watched as long as he remained
in sight, and the imminent peril in which he
was seen: his heart-rending cries, and desperate
struggles, long left their unpleasant impression
on the memory of all who beheld him.</p>

<p>The bold outline of the coast they were approaching
every hour became more apparent:
its singular mountain and other landmarks were
seen, pointed out, and commented on. Birds
flew into the rigging&mdash;weeds accumulated before
the ship&mdash;and stray logs of timber, broken
barrels, and pieces of wreck, were continually
floating past. The character of the scenery now
began to be clearly defined&mdash;the lowlands
spreading out far and wide into the interior,
intersected by numerous railroads, and the
mountains holding up their proud heads covered
with vegetation nearly to their summits. The
more the country became visible, the greater
was the evidence it exhibited of a high degree
of cultivation, a fruitful soil, and a numerous
and industrious population; and as buildings
began to be made out, it was observable from
their form, numbers, and disposition, that manufactures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was a primary object in the estimation
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will find these people a money-getting
generation,&rdquo; said the professor to his pupil:
&ldquo;their sole object appears to be to accumulate,
and their only idea of the respectability of a person
is derived from the proportion of substance
he is worth. They never ask, is a man an excellent
husband, an exemplary father, or an admirable
citizen?&mdash;is he distinguished by the attention
with which he fulfils his moral duties, or celebrated
by the right application of extraordinary
talents? they merely inquire how much money
he has in his pockets. In fact, when they speak
at all of &lsquo;a good man,&rsquo; they allude to some individual
imagined to be possessed of a certain
amount of available property: money with them
is every thing. Respectability means money&mdash;reputation
or credit means money, and cleverness
means money. Money, therefore, is the
universal virtue: they who have the most are
honoured the most, and they who have it not at
all are considered by those who have it, although
in ever so small a proportion, as being separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
from their fellow-creatures by an impassable
chasm, where all that is infamous is thought to
dwell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet they are considered to be a very
religious people,&rdquo; remarked Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None are more regular in going to church,
none are greater respecters of the ceremonies of
worship, but of religion they are ignorant,&rdquo;
replied Fortyfolios. &ldquo;Nothing can be more certain
than that it is impossible that a pure
morality or a sincere devotion can exist, when
the heart is filled with one engrossing desire&mdash;the
accumulation of capital&mdash;the very principle
of which is selfishness&mdash;a feeling incompatible
with the social charities of true religion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when did you ever find that any thing
like true religion generally existed?&rdquo; inquired
the captain, in a tone approaching sarcasm.
&ldquo;Since the memory of man the faith of the majority
has been unvaryingly orthodox, and sticks,
like a lobster to its shell, to the old proverb,
&lsquo;Every one for himself, and the devil take the
hindmost,&rsquo;&mdash;and more absurd conduct doesn&rsquo;t
exist than some people exhibit, who, after having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
made money a standard of excellence, condemn
to infamy not only those who are not
possessed of it, but they who gain it by means
not in exact accordance with their notions of the
way it should be obtained. Scrunch me, if it
don&rsquo;t make one ready to heave one&rsquo;s ballast overboard,
when I see the homage paid to a mean-spirited
scoundrel, who by chicanery, hypocrisy,
avarice, and a horde of other contemptible vices,
robs his fellows of a pretty handsome share of
plunder; and hear the execrations heaped upon
the bolder and better villain, who lays society
under contributions in a more open, manly, and
daring manner. They pretend to notions of
honesty, too, that&rsquo;s the joke. Why a fish would
laugh at a thing so ridiculous. The government
in their necessity take from the people, and
those who can&rsquo;t afford to pay they send to
prison&mdash;an individual in his necessity takes
from another, and the very government who set
the example of appropriation punish the appropriator
as an offender. Then governments
plunder each other, or rather the people of each
other; but when any of the people attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
rob their governments, they judge, hang, draw
and quarter the poor wretches without the
slightest mercy. Honesty, forsooth! If the whole
world were asked what the meaning of the word
was, every man would give a different definition,
and not only would each contradict the other,
but every one would contradict himself. Honesty
appears to be of all shapes and all sizes:
it will suit all complexions&mdash;it will flavour every
dish. Honesty is every thing, and yet it is
nothing. It is neither fish, flesh, nor fowl&mdash;will
neither sink nor swim&mdash;and is not to be touched,
seen, or tasted. Honesty is every where&mdash;the
greatest rogue is honest to his chosen associates&mdash;and
yet it is no where, for the desire of appropriation
is universal. It is a sort of ghost that
only exists in the minds of the superstitious&mdash;a
mirror that shows any reflection thrown upon it&mdash;a
sky that all over the world can take every
variety of colour. Some call it truth, and lay
claim to its possession, although their lives are
a continual deceit; some call it justice, and
fancy themselves exceedingly just, although they
would consign to eternal perdition all not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
exactly of their way of thinking; and some call
it conscientiousness, and are satisfied with their
own dealings, when, at the same time, their first
thought is for their own personal gratification.
But we are entering the bay, and these fellows
require looking after.&rdquo; So saying, he suddenly
left the group, and began shouting to the crew
some orders about the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Compass has singular notions,&rdquo;
remarked the professor: &ldquo;I should not feel
particularly comfortable if I thought he entertained
the opinions he expresses. There would
be an end to all sense of moral obligations if
such ideas became general.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh there is no harm in him,&rdquo; replied
Oriel. &ldquo;He is too frank, too careless, too bold
to have any evil intention. It has often appeared
to me, though, that the principle we
call honesty does not exist either in ourselves
or in society to the extent we imagine; and
believing such a state of things an evil, I have
often wished, but never been able, to find a way
in which it could be remedied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an evil, undoubtedly,&rdquo; here observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Doctor Tourniquet, who had for some time been
an attentive but silent listener&mdash;&ldquo;and there is
but one way in which it can be completely
removed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is that way to be found?&rdquo; inquired
Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cause of this want of a definite unvarying
character in our notion of honesty,&rdquo;
said the Doctor, &ldquo;may be traced to the present
and past construction of society, where each
individual has a separate interest, exists in a
state of competition with the others, and must
always be endeavouring to shape his own notions
of right to his own exclusive advantage: were
property a fund in common from which each
might be allowed to take what he pleased&mdash;there
being no individual interests, the world
would be one family, and there could be no
dishonesty in openly appropriating that to which
he had an acknowledged right, don&rsquo;t you
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Preposterous!&rdquo; exclaimed Fortyfolios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An impossible state of things, I should
think,&rdquo; added his pupil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing more reasonable, and nothing
more easy,&rdquo; replied the Doctor. &ldquo;Let every
one in a community labour equally according
to his physical or mental powers&mdash;every kind
of labour being productive will produce every
thing in abundance&mdash;this abundance having
been produced must supply every want&mdash;every
want being gratified at the suggestion of the
inclination, there remains nothing to desire&mdash;and
as all have an equal right to appropriate as
much as they require for the gratification of
their inclinations, by having equally, according
to their abilities, assisted in producing the
abundance they enjoy, no desire in which they
might think fit to indulge could ever take the
appearance of an act of dishonesty, don&rsquo;t you
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; exclaimed the professor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how in the present state of society
can you get such notions adopted?&rdquo; inquired
Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either by educating children from the
earliest age into the application of these social
principles, or by constituting communities apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
from the general mass, who will exist within
themselves by the same manner of life, till, as
the advantages of such a state of society become
universally evident, it is adopted by the
whole population,&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing has been tried times out of
number,&rdquo; remarked Fortyfolios, contemptuously,
&ldquo;and has always lingered a short time and then
died, with very little regret on the part of those
for whose superior happiness it was created. It
is based upon an idea of equality, which idea
has no personal existence in nature. No matter
how carefully the young mind is schooled, there
will always be some superiority somewhere.
In muscular energy, in mental power, in ingenuity,
in quickness of comprehension, and in
the skilful adaptation of means to an end&mdash;even
in the natural desires and susceptibilities&mdash;even
in acquired habits of industry, and self-denial,
in all societies, some will be found
greater than others, and these will endeavour
to rise above the equality by which they are
surrounded; perhaps they will succeed, and then
the homogeneousness of the community is soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
destroyed; perhaps they will fail, and then
their more exalted natures must be crushed
down to the Procrustean bed of their associates.
Equality can only be a state of general mediocrity.
Could we imagine such a social organisation,
what would become of the worship
of superior greatness that leads men to become
great? With what feelings would exist, could
they exist under such circumstances, those commanding
intellects whose supremacy should be
acknowledged by all who love knowledge, and
virtue, and humanity, at finding themselves
classed with the mere breaker of the clod, a
creature without an idea, whose only quality,
that of strength and fitness for a certain labour,
he shares with brutes and with machines; who
eats and drinks, and sleeps and dies, and then
makes room for another of the same class?
Must they also become hewers of wood and
drawers of water for the benefit of their fellows?
With as much probability of a beneficial result
might an attempt be made to force the ploughman,
the shepherd, the mechanic, and the
domestic servant, to become a sculptor, a philologist,
a musician, and a philosopher.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>What Doctor Tourniquet might have replied,
it is impossible now to relate, as the Albatross
at that moment was boarded by the port-officers
who came to examine the state of health of the
ship and the cargo with which she was laden;
and as she was expected shortly to drop her
anchor among the shipping with which she was
now surrounded, those who designed to land
proceeded to make the necessary preparations.</p>

<br />
<span class="f8">CAFFRETON, THE METROPOLIS OF SOUTHERN
AFRICA.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">In</span> a large heavy building on the banks of a
canal in the city of Caffreton, all seemed bustle
and confusion: barges were at the water side
unloading, and at the land side were waggons
being filled with packages for conveyance into
the interior by the rail-roads, and others starting
off heavily laden to supply the traders in
the town and neighbourhood. A considerable
number of black slaves were actively employed
in assisting the goods from the barges to the
stores, and from the stores to the waggons; who
jostled, shouted, and chattered apparently with
as much noise as they could make; two or
three white men were seen among them giving
orders in a loud voice to their dark associates,
and seeing that their commands were promptly
attended to. Under a gloomy archway, which
led from the street to the water side were doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
opposite each other. One of these, after passing
through a long warehouse filled with articles
of merchandise of every description, in the
midst of which were several slaves of both sexes
engaged in weighing, measuring, and packing
parcels of various sizes, led into a counting
house, in which about a dozen blacks, principally
young ones, much better dressed than
those in the warehouse, were writing in large
books; and beyond this was a much smaller
room, furnished with maps and a few cumbrous
books, wherein two men were seated opposite each
other; one a tall, thin, sharp visaged man about
forty, whose features expressed an extraordinary
degree of fear and servility, was reading a newspaper,
and the other, who appeared considerably
older, was short and corpulent, had a dark
complexion, and a look of mingled cunning and
fierceness, sat leaning back against a huge arm
chair, with an open ledger on the table before
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foreign stock rising, eh!&rdquo; inquired the
latter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the other, glancing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
eye over the paper, &ldquo;particularly Columbian
and Australian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How goes the share market?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brisk, sir, in many things&mdash;Gondar Railroad
at a premium&mdash;Congo Canal at 125&#8540;&mdash;Ashantee
Salt Company, 105&frac12;&mdash;Mocaranga
Timber, 109&mdash;Biafra Gold Mines, 200.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; exclaimed the elder, rubbing his
hands together briskly, and his forbidding features
assuming an expression of intense gratification.
&ldquo;I shall do well by my speculations
there;&mdash;but how goes the Madagascar Silkworm
Company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down to 45, sir,&rdquo; replied the thin man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bankrupt and jails! you scoundrel, it can&rsquo;t
be,&rdquo; furiously exclaimed the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so here, sir,&rdquo; said his companion
humbly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then my eternal malediction rest on all
silk worms. I&rsquo;ve lost some thousands. But
you haven&rsquo;t said any thing about the Timbuctoo
Beet-root Sugar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down to 22, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You rascal, you&rsquo;re trying to put me in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
passion; you&rsquo;re inventing that, because you
know I&rsquo;ve invested large sums in that affair. I&rsquo;ll
have you whipped like a slave if you don&rsquo;t tell
me the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so here, sir,&rdquo; said the man trembling,
and turning pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the Caffreton Universal Intelligence
is a universal liar!&rdquo; screamed the other in a
rage. &ldquo;Why, if it&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;ve lost all I gained by
the indigo and cochineal job. It&rsquo;s a bad business,
Mr. Quagga. There&rsquo;s cheating in it!
There&rsquo;s ruination in it! I shall be laughed at
on &lsquo;Change. My solvency will be suspected&mdash;my
credit diminish;&mdash;but go on, Mr. Quagga&mdash;go
on, I&rsquo;m perfectly cool&mdash;I&rsquo;m not going to
put myself out of temper by such a loss, don&rsquo;t
think it. In the name of poverty, why don&rsquo;t
you go on, Mr. Quagga?&rdquo; thundered out the
principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wer&mdash;wer&mdash;wer&mdash;wer&mdash;what shall I read
next sir?&rdquo; inquired his servant as plainly as his
fright would allow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read the arrivals, you stuttering, stupid
blockhead,&rdquo; cried the broker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrived in the bay, the Sultan from Cairo,
Selim, master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Golden Horn, from Stamboul, Mahmoud,
master:&mdash;twenty chests of opium, consigned
by Mandragora and Poppy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send some one to see it warehoused in the
docks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk, respectfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Hellas, from Smyrna, Mavricordato,
master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing for me. Cargo of figs and raisins,
from Drum and Company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Albatross, from Columbus, Compass,
master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look to that, Quagga&mdash;look to that. She
belongs to Master Porphyry, the richest merchant
in the whole world. Her cargo is of
great value. By last advices from my correspondent,
expect some bales of rich fabrics.&mdash;Go
on, Quagga.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a paragraph, here, sir, that seems
to relate to that vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Read it, Quagga.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In the Albatross, arrived in our harbour,
comes the only son of the great merchant,
Master Porphyry, whose name is in such high
estimation in every part of the civilised world
for his wealth and his philanthropy. It is said
that he has come out on a commercial voyage,
and that it was Master Porphyry&rsquo;s desire that
his son should visit some of the most celebrated
places of traffic in various parts of the
globe.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, except philanthropy, which
is all humbug, you know, Quagga,&rdquo; observed
the broker, &ldquo;a bad spec&mdash;a dead loss.&mdash;We
must look after him&rdquo;&mdash;and the face of the master
seemed to glance more pleasantly upon his
servant.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, what provincial news?&rdquo;
he asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We regret to inform our readers, that the
respectable banking house of Mangel Wurzel,
Carrots, and Co., at Lattakoo, have stopped
payment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stopped payment, you rascal!&rdquo; shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the broker, his face becoming purple with rage.
&ldquo;How dare you tell me Mangel Wurzel and
Co. have stopped payment? It&rsquo;s all a conspiracy&mdash;a
base invention&mdash;a lie&mdash;a cheat!
You know I&rsquo;ve got all the payments made to
me per the Springbok&mdash;on account of that
fine gang of Hottentots&mdash;in their wretched
paper. I&rsquo;ll have you hanged, you scoundrel,
for deceiving me. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the torrent of his indignation was interrupted
by one of the young slaves from the
counting-house showing himself at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you imp of darkness! what do you
want?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;ain Gumpas, sar, want to peak wi&rsquo;
you,&rdquo; said the young Hottentot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who, scoundrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;ain Gumpass, sar, ship Albatross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admit him, instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slave disappeared, and so did the broker&rsquo;s
passion.</p>

<p>In a moment afterwards the door opened, and
a tall man, of rather handsome exterior, whom
it would have been impossible to have recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as the Captain Compass of the Albatross,
had it not been for a peculiar expression in the
countenance&mdash;sarcastic, bold, and treacherous&mdash;no
one could mistake, entered the room. His
whiskers had disappeared, the colour of his hair
had changed, and he looked a much younger
and better featured man than he appeared the
day previous. As he advanced, the broker
seemed to gaze upon him with fear and wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old Boor, is this the hail I&rsquo;m to meet
after such a long cruise?&rdquo; cried the captain.</p>

<p>Boor stared till his yellow eye-balls appeared
starting out of his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dockets and bad bills!&rdquo; at last he exclaimed,
with a long breath, &ldquo;surely it can&rsquo;t be
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is, though, old boy, and I&rsquo;m afloat
in the most slappish style,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how did you escape, when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said the captain, interrupting
his companion. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m come to have a little bit
of a confabulation with you about a matter that
will enrich us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way, my good friend,&rdquo; hastily whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the broker, leading his associate cautiously
to a little door at the further extremity of the
room, which opened into a smaller apartment,
filled with iron safes, papers, and books. &ldquo;This
way, captain&mdash;this way,&rdquo; added he; then turning
to his clerk, said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me be interrupted,
Quagga,&rdquo; as the door opened and
closed upon the pair: and there they remained
in close conference for a full hour, to the great
mystification of the principal clerk. When they
returned, the features of the captain wore an
air of triumph, and the countenance of Boor
expressed all the congratulation of successful
cunning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every thing shall be managed according to
your desire, captain,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be cautious,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon that,&rdquo; responded his companion.
&ldquo;You had better go out at this side
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain was going out as directed, when
he quickly asked, &ldquo;When shall I see you
again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow night,&rdquo; replied his associate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When his visiter had taken his departure, the
broker seemed to have forgotten the losses that
had affected him so much a short time previous.
His unprepossessing countenance appeared lit
up with a continual smile of inward satisfaction,
as he leaned back upon his chair, occasionally
resting his hands upon his capacious stomach,
then crossing his arms&mdash;then leaning his chin
upon his hand as if in deep reflection, uttering
such ejaculations as &ldquo;capital scheme&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;hazardous
though&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;daring villain&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;worth
the risk,&rdquo; and others of a similar nature&mdash;till
the wondering Quagga, neither daring to move
or to speak, began to imagine that his tyrannical
master had lost the use of his senses. At
that moment the door opened again, and the
same slave made his appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, Beelzebub!&rdquo; shouted Master Boor,
&ldquo;what now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Massa Porfry, sar, and young gennleman
ob colour wish to peak wi&rsquo; you,&rdquo; said the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admit them,&rdquo; he exclaimed. Then in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
lower tone said, &ldquo;Coloured persons! what can
he mean by bringing such vermin here?&rdquo; However,
though considering the introduction of
such a person an indignity, the game he had to
play induced him for the present to forget his
prejudices, and he met his visitors with every
appearance of cordiality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to Caffreton, welcome to the
sunny shores of Afrik;&rdquo; he cried as they advanced
into the room. &ldquo;The land of universal
liberty.&mdash;Quagga, tell those slaves if I hear
them chattering again, I&rsquo;ll give them the
lash&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; said Quagga; and immediately
delivered the message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The land of universal equality.&mdash;Quagga,
you scoundrel! why don&rsquo;t you get seats for the
gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; said Quagga; and instantly did
as he was desired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the land of universal freedom of conscience.&mdash;Quagga!
tell Pipkin, that if he doesn&rsquo;t
choose to attend the same church as his master,
I&rsquo;ll thrash his soul out of his body.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Quagga; and Pipkin received
the brutal command.</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry seemed in some degree
amused by this exemplification of liberty, equality,
and freedom of conscience, but he said
nothing; and Zabra seemed intently observing
the countenances of the clerk and his master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope your worthy father is well, sir,&rdquo;
continued Boor. &ldquo;Health&rsquo;s a precious commodity&mdash;cannot
be too highly prized. Quagga!
is Nimbo in the warehouse yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; doctor says he can&rsquo;t stand,&rdquo; said
the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then tell him if he don&rsquo;t come down I&rsquo;ll
make him,&rdquo; said his master with ferocious
emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir;&rdquo; replied the obedient Quagga.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father does a deal of good, sir, with his
charities,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;Ah! charity&rsquo;s a fine
thing!&mdash;an admirable thing! I do a wonderful
deal of good myself that way sometimes. I give
the poor all the bad coin that comes into my
hands. I do a deal of good I assure you. Your
father enjoys a great reputation for integrity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
his dealings. Nothing like it, sir;&mdash;It is always
at a premium. Hope you will tread in your
father&rsquo;s footsteps; and if you should have a
desire for speculating, I trust the credit I
possess will induce you to place confidence in
me. I should recommend you to invest largely
in the shares of the Madagascar Silk Worm
Company, and the Timbuctoo Beet-root Sugar
Joint Stock Association. I have some shares at
my disposal, which, although they&rsquo;re now very
high in the market, to oblige the son of so respectable
a man as my correspondent, master
Porphyry, I would let you have at a fair price,&mdash;say
the first at 95&#8542;, and the other at 80.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am obliged to you,&rdquo; replied Oriel Porphyry;
&ldquo;but I have no desire to speculate in
such things at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good&mdash;very good,&rdquo; said the broker,
not at all disconcerted at the failure of his
schemes. &ldquo;Caution is advisable in all mercantile
transactions, and I am the last person in the
world to suggest any thing to you, which I do
not think would turn to your advantage. Perhaps
you have bullion to dispose of? If so, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
could afford a very handsome per centage, and
exchange with you to a considerable amount in
notes of one of the most steady banks in the
country&mdash;that of Mangel Wurzel, Carrots and
Co. at Lattakoo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you; but as my stay
in this part of the world must be brief, it would
not be advisable to change my bullion into the
paper currency of the country;&rdquo; said Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True&mdash;true;&rdquo; remarked master Boor, and
a cloud did pass over his gloomy countenance
when he found he could not dispose of any of
his unprofitable speculations. &ldquo;You are right.
So you do not intend staying here? Fine
country. No kings&mdash;none of <em>that</em> nonsense.
Every man does just as he likes, and cares for
nobody.&mdash;Quagga! you rascal, I&rsquo;ll have you
flayed alive if you don&rsquo;t finish that intricate
account with Botherem, Blunder, and Bigfist,
in an hour.&rdquo; The frightened clerk began to
write away with the speed of a steam-engine.
&ldquo;In no place in the world is the right of opinion
so much respected.&mdash;Quagga, you scoundrel!
I understand you spoke at the Universal Consolidated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Democratic Discussion Society, against
the measure now before the legislature for the
tax on tenpenny nails. How dare you oppose
my political sentiments! This is insolence,
sir&mdash;treason, anarchy, and rebellion! If ever
I hear you entertain an opinion different from
mine again, I&rsquo;ll have you inclosed within four
stone walls and starve you upon a mouthful a
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quagga trembled like an aspen, and did not
dare lift his eyes from the book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I repeat, this is the only country
on the face of the globe, where mankind enjoy
a perfect state of civil and religious liberty.
What do they think of us, sir, in Columbia?
Don&rsquo;t they envy us our noble institutions, ey?
Our excellent government&mdash;our enlightened
people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, those who ever do think of the African
states&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever think of them!&rdquo; cried the old fellow,
with emphasis, interrupting the speaker; &ldquo;they
must always think of them. They cannot help
drawing comparisons, sir, with their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
wretched state; and they must therefore be
wonderfully desirous of sharing in the blessings
we enjoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really never heard of such a desire existing
in any part of the country;&rdquo; observed Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, sir, they live in a wretched state of
despotism, and they dare not express their sentiments;&rdquo;
replied the broker. &ldquo;There cannot
be anything like public virtue amongst them&mdash;no
political honesty&mdash;no notion of true liberty.
But how did you make the voyage, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admirably!&rdquo; exclaimed the merchant&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;The Albatross is one of the most perfect
vessels that was ever launched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing like the African shipping, depend
upon it&mdash;made of free timber, sir?&mdash;beat all
vessels at sailing, and last for ever. Skilful
captain that Compass, sir&mdash;known him long;
knew his father&mdash;highly respectable. You
may place the greatest confidence in him, I
assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the preceding sentences Zabra kept
his eyes fixed upon the face of the speaker,
which he observing, turned his own gaze upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the person so earnestly regarding him; but the
piercing look that met his quite disconcerted
him. His complexion grew more livid; his
look became confused; he frowned and smiled
by turns; he shifted his position, and evinced
by many other signs that he was anything but
at ease under the scrutiny to which he was
subjected. At last, unable to endure it any
longer, he said, in a tone in which anger seemed
struggling with indifference. &ldquo;Who is that
person of colour, sir? it is not usual to bring
people of that class in company with free
Africans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young gentleman is my most esteemed
and intimate friend;&rdquo; replied Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg pardon; but it&rsquo;s not respectable
to have such friends in a free and enlightened
country like the African States; and the &lsquo;young
gentleman&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he, with contemptuous emphasis,
&ldquo;seems to look on me as if he knew me
intimately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do know you intimately, sir;&rdquo; remarked
Zabra, bending on the old man a stern and
searching look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this assurance beats any thing I ever
saw. Why, I never met with your coppery
countenance before,&rdquo; said the broker, indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke the truth <em>there</em>,&rdquo; replied Zabra,
still continuing to regard him with the same
earnestness; and the broker&rsquo;s attempts to conceal
his passion and his uneasiness became every
moment more unsuccessful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is thus to every one,&rdquo; observed Oriel
Porphyry; &ldquo;and he means no offence. But let
us proceed to business. According to your
request, my father has sent you a lot of fabrics
of the choicest patterns and materials, which I
shall give you an order to remove from the
docks upon receiving payment in gold. You
can examine them if necessary, whenever it is
convenient to you, when you will find them
exactly of the description you ordered. I am
also commissioned to purchase, to any amount,
ivory, gold dust, gums, pearls and precious
stones, ostrich feathers, amber, and any other
article of traffic of approved quality that may
suit the Columbian markets, or that may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
turned to a profitable account during my
voyage. They can be paid for in money or in
goods&mdash;whichever should be most desirable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good&mdash;good,&rdquo; remarked the broker, losing,
in his attention to business, all his angry
feelings. &ldquo;Ah! let me see. I think I shall be
able to treat with you for a considerable portion
of your cargo; and, as a particular friend, I
should not advise you to go to any strange
brokers; they&rsquo;ll take you in, depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought, in this free country, all
your transactions were distinguished by a degree
of honesty superior to that of other nations;&rdquo;
said Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; hastily replied master Boor,
considerably puzzled to account for the discrepancy
in his statements. &ldquo;But every man
will make a good bargain, if he can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what offer are you inclined to make
for a thousand bales of lace and cambric goods,
best quality?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, master Porphyry, the truth
is, the market here is a little overstocked just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
now with those articles; they are a complete
drug.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have good reason to believe there is a
great demand for them,&rdquo; said Oriel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind, master Porphyry.
I wouldn&rsquo;t deceive you for the world. But,
although things are so heavy, I don&rsquo;t mind
offering twenty thousand dollars for them,
either in money or goods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just half I am commissioned to
take;&rdquo; remarked the young merchant, rising to
go away. &ldquo;And as we shall not be able to
do business on those terms, I must seek a more
advantageous market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hasty, sir. Reflect before
you determine. The price I offer is a good
price; and it is impossible you can get one so
high, search Caffreton through and through.&rdquo;
Perceiving his visitors were at the door, he
added&mdash;&ldquo;Suppose we say five and twenty&mdash;a
great risk&mdash;a hazardous&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good day to you, master Boor!&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel, bending his head proudly, and
departed with his companion through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
counting-house. The old man scowled after
his visitors, muttering to himself,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
them at a less price, in spite of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About the same time two persons were seen
walking cautiously through a narrow unfrequented
street in the suburbs of the town, connected
with a number of other thoroughfares
of a like description, chiefly inhabited by the
lowest class of the black population. The
tallest of the two, who was a little in advance
of his companion, whose short dumpy figure
and conceited physiognomy it was impossible
to mistake, turned round, and addressed his
associate:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, master Log, show more sail. I&rsquo;m
spiflicated if we shall ever find safe anchorage
if you don&rsquo;t. I think I arn&rsquo;t forgotten the landmarks;
but, somehow, I&rsquo;ve got into a little bit
of a mystification about making the proper
tacks. This is it! No, it arn&rsquo;t! Ha! Now
I see, as clean as a cable. There&rsquo;s the sign o&rsquo;
the Ship, at the corner yonder. We goes right
ahead there; then we makes a tack; then we goes
ahead again; then we makes another tack;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
then I knows all the whereabouts. That&rsquo;s
right, arnt it, mister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right&mdash;right&mdash;very right&mdash;decidedly right&mdash;absolutely
right: indeed, I may say, positively
right, mister Scrumpydike,&rdquo; responded the
little man, endeavouring to keep pace with his
more bulky companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes another Hottentot;&rdquo; said
Scrumpydike, noticing an individual of that
race approaching them. &ldquo;What a lot o&rsquo; them
black craft one meets wi&rsquo; steerin&rsquo; about in these
here seas; they puts one in mind o&rsquo; a fleet of
colliers, creepin&rsquo; along shore. But this nigger
<em>is</em> black, arnt he, master Log?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black, black,&mdash;monstrous black,&mdash;very
monstrous black&mdash;upon my word most diabolically
black, mister Scrumpydike;&rdquo; replied the
captain&rsquo;s clerk, puffing and blowing with the
exertion he made to prolong his walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, won&rsquo;t them bugaboos afloat entertain
something of a &rsquo;stonishment when we commences
the fun. Don&rsquo;t you think some on &rsquo;em
&rsquo;ll go mad?&rdquo; inquired the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mad, mad,&mdash;very mad, very mad, indeed,&mdash;pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
considerably wild, stiff, stark, staring
mad, mister Scrumpydike,&rdquo; rejoined his companion.</p>

<p>They had now reached one of the narrowest,
darkest, and filthiest streets in that quarter of
the town; and by the expression of satisfaction
that gleamed on the coarse features of Scrumpydike,
it was evident that they were near the
end of their journey. They proceeded along
this street till they came to a court through
which they passed, and entered a lane where
there were no houses on one side, and very few,
and those far apart on the other. Keeping on
the side where the houses were, they followed
the footpath, till they came to a ruined habitation
of the poorest class, little better than a mud
kraal. The few windows it possessed were
broken and covered with dirt; its door was
battered to a fragment; the roof had fallen in, and
the walls threatened to tumble. Looking cautiously
round to see if any persons were observing
them, the sailor removed the door to admit
himself and his companion, and then carefully
replaced it; afterwards they picked their way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
over fragments of stone and timber, through a
moderate sized chamber, and descended a long
flight of steps till they came to a wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ship ahoy!&rdquo; shouted Scrumpydike, putting
his mouth near the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cheer?&rdquo; was answered in a low voice
from within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death and gold!&rdquo; was the strange reply;
immediately after which, bolts were heard
quickly drawn, and the wall, or rather a door
made to resemble the wall in which it was
placed opened, and a stout, active man of a
fierce aspect, clad in coarse jacket and trowsers,
without shoes or cap, carrying a naked cutlass
in his hand, and wearing several large pistols in
his belt, became visible by the light of a torch
that burned stuck upright in the ground beside
him. Without another word Log and Scrumpydike
entered. The door was quickly closed,
the bolts set, and the man, taking up the
torch, preceded them through a long passage or
cellar, till they were stopped by the brickwork.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ship ahoy!&rdquo; shouted the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cheer?&rdquo; was answered from within.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Death and gold!&rdquo; he replied. In an instant
another door opened, the man turned
back, and the captain&rsquo;s clerk, and his companion
were admitted into a long subterranean chamber,
in which the many torches that were burning
enabled them to distinguish the figures of
about twenty men, dressed like sailors, all variously
armed, seated round a large table covered
with drinking vessels. Immediately Scrumpydike
made his appearance, the whole party set
up a loud shout of welcome, and in a moment
they were all crowding round him, shaking
hands, asking questions, and offering him refreshment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! let us stow in a cargo o&rsquo; some sort or
other,&rdquo; said the sailor, seating himself before
what appeared to be the remains of a roast kid,
and proceeding to help himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a
desperate long cruise here. Come, master Log,
bear a hand:&rdquo; a command the captain&rsquo;s clerk
was not slow in executing. &ldquo;And so you&rsquo;d given
me up, ey? never made a worser recknin; scrunch
me if I arnt a got more lives nor a cat. But the
best of the joke is,&rdquo; said he taking a hearty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
draught from a can of liquor which was handed
to him, and which example was immediately followed
by his companion; &ldquo;the best o&rsquo; the
joke is&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m gammonin&rsquo; ye&mdash;I
knows you will. The joke is&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been
livin&rsquo; in the most honestest way you ever
heard on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole party raised a shout of incredulity,
and laughed in derision at such an idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know&rsquo;d how it would be&mdash;I was afear&rsquo;d
I should lose my precious character,&rdquo; remarked
the man gloomily; &ldquo;but master Log can tell
ye as how I ha&rsquo; been for a matter o&rsquo; two or three
months most abominably honest,&mdash;arn&rsquo;t I
master Log?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honest&mdash;honest,&rdquo; replied the captain&rsquo;s
clerk, moving the wine can from his mouth a
short distance; &ldquo;shamefully honest&mdash;disgracefully
honest&mdash;indeed I may say villainously
honest, master Scrumpydike.&rdquo; The men stared
with astonishment, and many still seemed to
doubt his assertion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody can lament the unfortnit occurrence
more nor I do,&rdquo; said Scrumpydike; &ldquo;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
what&rsquo;s done can&rsquo;t be undone,&mdash;so clear the
decks o&rsquo; this lumber&mdash;pipe all hands to grog,
and I&rsquo;ll tell ye a sort o&rsquo; summat much more
nat&rsquo;ral and creditable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eatables were cleared off into an open
pantry at the side, and fresh flasks of liquor and
drinking vessels were placed on the table. Some
of the men began to smoke from long pipes;
others made for themselves mixtures of the different
beverages before them; and every one sat
himself down laughing and joking with the rest
with the evident intention of commencing a carouse.
Log having procured a pipe almost as
big as himself, and a large jug of a strong potation
he had carefully prepared, sat smirking
with secret satisfaction at his own comfort. His
pig-like eyes twinkled with self-conceit, and his
pug nose seemed to curl itself up with delight.
Opposite to him, but not less at his ease, sat
Scrumpydike. He also had taken care of himself
after a similar fashion; and the humorous
twist of his ugly countenance became every minute
more evident. The set by whom they were surrounded,
were remarkable for the daring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
somewhat ferocious character of their features,
and the great variety of their costumes; and as
they sat enveloped in the smoke they were creating,
bandying the ready jest, and pushing
about the intoxicating liquor, they presented to
the eye a band of as determined ruffians as the
whole world could have produced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you all a mind for a job?&rdquo; at last
inquired Scrumpydike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one on us,&rdquo; replied a stout fellow
with a red nose and a fierce squint. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been laid up here for a month or more, waiting
for a &rsquo;portunity to get afloat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Billbo! you shall go aboard a prime
craft afore another week&rsquo;s out, or I&rsquo;m less nor
nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurra!&rdquo; exclaimed the men joyfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell ye the &rsquo;ticulars just now,&rdquo; he
continued; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll make it all plain sailin&rsquo;
afore you goes. Push the stuff about; a ship
at anchor makes no way. Here&rsquo;s to ye, my
trumps! wi&rsquo; lots o&rsquo; plunder and a wide berth;
and may we stick to one another while there&rsquo;s
a plank left for us to stand on.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurra!&rdquo; replied his associates with increased
delight! and they all seemed now to
abandon themselves to riot and debauchery with
additional zest. Briskly were the liquor cans
replenished, rapidly was the tobacco consumed;&mdash;the
laugh became louder, and occasionally an
attempt at a ribald song was made by some of
the more musical members of the company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, scrunch me! if this arn&rsquo;t pleasant in
the extreme,&rdquo; said the individual addressed as
Billbo; who, by the vacuity of his gaze, and
the unsteadiness of his body, was evidently far
gone towards complete intoxication. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as
happy as if I was a cap&rsquo;ain. I&rsquo;m happier nor
any body. I&rsquo;m happier nor any body, afloat
or ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You arn&rsquo;t more happier nor me!&rdquo; shouted
a big-headed fellow fiercely, from the other end
of the table, as he attempted to get upon his
legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happier nor any body,&rdquo; repeated the
man with the squint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t allow nobody to be more happier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
nor me,&rdquo; cried the other, as he, after repeated
efforts, attained the perpendicular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happier nor any body,&rdquo; doggedly repeated
Billbo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m spiflicated if I don&rsquo;t give you
toko, &rsquo;cause you arn&rsquo;t no business to be more
happier nor me,&rdquo; rejoined his associate, attempting
to draw his cutlass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, Loggerhead!&rdquo; shouted Scrumpydike,
in a voice of thunder that made the captain&rsquo;s
clerk start from his seat with affright.
&ldquo;No squabbling, or you&rsquo;ll get a broadside from
one as arn&rsquo;t fond o&rsquo; trifling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s more happier nor me,&rdquo; exclaimed
Loggerhead, in a most lachrymose tone
of voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happier nor any body,&rdquo; repeated the
pertinacious Billbo, his eyes squinting defiance
upon his jealous antagonist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence, Billbo!&rdquo; shouted Scrumpydike,
&ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll rake ye fore and aft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He arn&rsquo;t no right to be more happier nor
me,&rdquo; cried Loggerhead, as the tears swelled in
his eyes at such an assumption of superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
happiness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy!&rdquo; he added, in a
manner the most miserable that can be conceived.
&ldquo;Unkimmon happy. I&rsquo;m as happy
as a fellow can be in this here molloncholy
world;&rdquo; and he began crying like a fretful
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happier nor any body,&rdquo; muttered the
other, sinking back upon the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a song!&rdquo; cried Scrumpydike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A song, a song,&rdquo; echoed as many of his
associates as were able to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A song, master Log,&rdquo; continued Scrumpydike,
with the desire of preventing a quarrel
among his drunken companions. &ldquo;Come, my
prince o&rsquo; singing birds! Pipe away till all&rsquo;s
blue. You&rsquo;re a reg&rsquo;lar trump at chaunting
a good stave; a right-down warbler; a nightingale&rsquo;s
a fool to ye. Arn&rsquo;t it true, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, true&mdash;very true&mdash;undeniably true&mdash;most
undeniably true&mdash;most undeniably true,
indeed, mister Scrumpydike,&rdquo; cried the captain&rsquo;s
clerk, his gratified vanity visible even
through the sleepy expression that now characterised
his countenance; and after a few preparatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
hems, considerable smirking, and a
plentiful affectation of modesty, he sang, in a
voice that might have frightened an owl, the
following verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>While his associates were wildly shouting, in
a dozen different keys, the burthen of the song,
Log, in whom the exertion of singing had destroyed
the little sense he had remaining, as he
was swinging his body back, lost his balance,
pitched head over heels off his seat, and then
rolled under the table, in a state of complete
insensibility.</p>

<p class="noi">&ldquo;&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Tis</span> a lovely night!&rdquo; observed Oriel Porphyry,
as he stood upon the deck of the Albatross,
watching the fast receding shores of Africa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; said his companion. &ldquo;The
air is filled with beauty, and there is an eloquent
glory in the stars that speaks marvels of wisdom.
See how the rolling waves rush on, bathed with
the trembling light from above them&mdash;so do
the multitudinous hearts within the world send
forth their tide, each illumined by glimpses of a
heaven of its own. The planets look down upon
the waters, and from their mighty mirror drink
in the images of their own loveliness&mdash;just as
the maiden venturing to gaze into the glowing
eyes of the youth of whom she is enamoured,
sees in their depths the reflection of her own
beauty, and lingers delighted within the influence
of the charm she herself created. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
what a philanthropist is the world! A universal
spirit of love exists around us, and
beneath its outstretched wings throbs the everlasting
heart of the universe, distributing through
its rosy channels that refreshing stream which
is the life, the strength, the humanity of nature.
What a wonder is the world! All within the
boundless circle of infinity, with a harmony of
soul-entrancing modulations, tune the same
music to the ear. Systems of worlds, and worlds
of systems&mdash;each earth blessed with its own
sun, moon, and stars, that fill its atmosphere
with gladness, and its waters with delight, rejoicing
in the abundance in which it rears its
countless offspring, that draw their verdure, their
fragrance, and their consummate grace, from
the exhaustless nourishment of its breast, rolls
on in one unvarying course, carrying with it
the fond desires of youth, the proud ambition
of manhood, and the peaceful speculations of
age; while, as the stream of Time progresses
on its way to float them into the shoreless
ocean of Eternity, its own nature, keeping a
continual change in all things which have from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it their existence, from the beginning hath followed
its particular path in the glad possession
of a perpetual youth. What a gladness is the
world! There is not a creature born of its
most fruitful womb that is not taught to slake
its thirst and bathe its buoyant limbs in the
fountain of delight that flows for all. Smiles
and flowers are about us from our infancy.
The air breathes of gladness. The clear firmament
looks down on us in bliss. The leaves
that quiver in the breeze dance for joy, and the
stream that wandereth on its way singeth its
own merry tune. The voice of song murmurs
a continual carol that stirs the hearts of the
antique forest trees, and the echoes of the
mighty hills&mdash;in swelling tones the vigorous
wind joins in the thrilling harmony&mdash;and as
the natural concert rises into power, into its
gladdening sounds the deep sea roars its triumphant
chorus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are eloquent, Zabra!&rdquo; remarked Oriel,
gazing with wondering eyes upon the handsome
countenance of his companion, which appeared
more than usually excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;T is a fit time, and a most fitting subject
for eloquence,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and if the soul
hath such impulses, never were they more likely
to be called into action than on such an occasion,
and with such a theme as I have now. We
are again upon the sea. That is sufficient impetus
for the thought. We have left the dwellings
of men whose souls were devoted to the
mere scraping together wealth they would not
use for any benefit to their fellow-creatures, and
could not expend with any happiness to themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, I am glad I have escaped from the
place,&rdquo; said the young merchant. &ldquo;It has given
me every thing but a favourable impression of
the pleasures of traffic. Each person I met
seemed anxiously intent upon cheating me;
and, if I had not been carefully attentive to my
father&rsquo;s instructions, before I had left their filthy
town I should have been plundered of every
bale of goods in my possession. As for Master
Boor, he is as fine a sample of deliberate roguery
as I ever met with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is worse than that, or I am much mistaken,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
remarked Zabra, earnestly. &ldquo;I have
not been able to collect sufficient proof, but I
strongly suspect, from observation I have made,
that he is connected with your captain, whom
he praised so much, in some deep-laid scheme
of treachery, of which you are to be the sufferer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel. &ldquo;That
Boor would cheat his own father, I believe;
but I don&rsquo;t think he would act the villain, except
in the general routine of business:&mdash;as for
Compass, there&rsquo;s no harm in him&mdash;the freedom
of his language and the unprepossessing character
of his manners are likely to create an
unfavourable impression in any observer. Besides,
he is alone in the ship, or nearly so. He
is not at all popular with the crew, and were he
to attempt any thing, the majority would rise
in my favour. No, no, Zabra, your suspicions
must be groundless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are those strange men that have
come on board?&rdquo; asked his companion, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those in long frocks and straw hats? They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
are some poor agricultural labourers that have
begged a free passage from the captain, which,
at his desire, I have granted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have received information, through the
boy Loop, from old Hearty, whose fidelity I
can depend on, that these men are not what
they appear to be; that they are evidently
sailors, and, from their countenances alone, I
should imagine that they are here for no good
purpose,&rdquo; said Zabra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel Porphyry, for the
first time entertaining a suspicion of the captain&rsquo;s
intentions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; whispered Zabra, clutching his
companion firmly at the arm, while the expression
of his features became intensely anxious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard you that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a stifled scream. While both listened
in great excitement, it was followed by a discharge
of fire-arms, a clashing of weapons,
shouts, imprecations, and yells of agony; and
immediately afterwards Hearty, Boggle, Ardent,
Climberkin, and about half a dozen others,
rushed upon deck, followed by Captain Compass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Scrumpydike, and the gang of ruffians described
in the last chapter, fighting furiously; and,
though streaming blood from many wounds,
obstinately disputing every inch of ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no weapon, but I must find one!&rdquo;
cried the young merchant, attempting to break
from his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Move not for your life, Oriel,&rdquo; said his
companion, earnestly, as he held him more
firmly. &ldquo;You can only be slaughtered, without
conferring the slightest assistance, for see, the
unequal struggle is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A loud cheer from the ruffians proclaimed
the truth of Zabra&rsquo;s intimation. The faithful
few were either killed, or so wounded as to be
unable to continue the contest, and the victors
were rejoicing at their triumph. Oriel Porphyry
was not allowed many moments to consider of
what he had best do, when Compass, Scrumpydike,
and two or three of their associates, came
hastily towards the place where he stood, flourishing
their bloody weapons, and shouting their
riotous hurras.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Compass!&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
proudly, as the party advanced, &ldquo;what is the
meaning of this bloodshed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, Master Porphyry,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;I have the honour of being Captain
Death; ey, boys?&rdquo; said he turning to his men,
and the appeal was answered by a noisy demonstration
of applause. &ldquo;Yes, I am Captain Death,
the most distinguished leader of the Free Mariners
in these seas; and I beg to inform you,
that I now hold the ship and all it contains for
the benefit of myself and brave companions; ey,
boys?&rdquo; and the inquiry met with a similar
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I begs to add to what the cap&rsquo;ain
says,&rdquo; observed Scrumpydike, giving his ugly
countenance a more ludicrous twist than ever,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;m Leevetenant Rifle, very much at
your sarvice, gennlemen; and if you has the
slightest &rsquo;clination to end your miserable lives,
I&rsquo;ll do the job handsome, and to show my respect
for ye, wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t charge ye nothin&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;a riotous
roar of laughter followed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid, Master Gloomy,&rdquo;
cried the captain, noticing that Zabra trembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
as he clung to Oriel Porphyry&mdash;&ldquo;your pretty
countenance shan&rsquo;t be spoilt just yet, at any rate,
if you behave yourself; and as for you, Master
Porphyry! your life shall be spared, and those
of your men who may have survived this conflict,
on condition that you follow my directions
regarding your conduct; but the slightest show
of disobedience will be punished with instant
death to yourself and all who belong to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Professor Fortyfolios and Doctor
Tourniquet had hurried upon deck, and with
much appearance of apprehension had joined
the group.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this dispute about, captain?&rdquo; asked
the professor, looking fearfully upon the threatening
faces he saw around him. &ldquo;Let us argue
the matter coolly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dispute is settled, Professor Fortyfolios,
and these are my arguments,&rdquo; said the pirate,
pointing to the bloody weapons of his companions.
The professor was convinced without
inquiry; and the perspiration seemed to break
out over his bald head as if he had taken a
shower bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This looks very much like an act of
piracy, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; remarked the incautious
Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So like, that there can be no difference,&rdquo;
replied the pirate; &ldquo;and you look as if you had
a great desire for a swing from the fore-yard
arm, or a plunge under the bows, don&rsquo;t you see.
But you are too useful at present, so look to
the wounded, Doctor Tourniquet, or I&rsquo;ll have
you hanged before you can suspect any thing
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor&rsquo;s ruddy features grew pale with
fear, and he made his way to his patients without
loss of time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Porphyry, you had better go to your
cabin,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;and your shadow
may go with you; but if I notice any treachery
in either, you shall not have time to say a
prayer.&rdquo; The friends left the deck together
without a reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, boys, hey for Madagascar; and as
this job&rsquo;s done, you may set your hearts afloat
as much as you like.&rdquo; A cheer followed the announcement&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
liquor was soon in requisition;
and the pirates became so incapable of
taking care of themselves, that if the defenders
of the ship who were alive had not been disabled
by their wounds, the Albatross might have
been retaken the same evening.</p>

<p>The wounded men were lying where they had
fallen when the doctor arrived amongst them.
In a moment his fear for himself disappeared in
his anxiety for the poor fellows who so much
required his assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Loop!&rdquo; he cried as soon as he noticed
the lad, unhurt, endeavouring to support
his wounded relative. &ldquo;Run into my cabin,
and you will find on the table there a case of
instruments, bring them here, look in at the
cook room as you return, and ask Roly Poly to
let me have a basin of warm water instantly, for
I have immediate want for it, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;
The boy, with tears in his eyes, left old Hearty
to the care of the surgeon, and hastened to obey
his instructions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old friend!&rdquo; exclaimed he, taking
the sailor by the hand, &ldquo;where are you hurt?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Ah, I perceive&mdash;ugly gash in the face&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you see&mdash;any thing else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arm cut to the bone, and shot through the
body,&rdquo; said the man faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; replied the doctor; &ldquo;but cheer up.
I&rsquo;ve put worse things than that to rights, don&rsquo;t
you see. There, let me take off your jacket.
Don&rsquo;t exert yourself: I&rsquo;ll do it. You&rsquo;ve lost a
good deal of blood, my friend, and feel a little
sickish or so. Never mind that. Now let me
move your shirt from the wound. Tut, tut,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, as the man seemed to shrink with
pain when the linen was withdrawn from the
lacerated flesh. &ldquo;You must learn to bear pain,
don&rsquo;t you see. Wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hurt you more than I can
help.&rdquo; He then minutely examined his patient&rsquo;s
hurts. &ldquo;Bad gun-shot wound that; but
the bullet&rsquo;s taken a more favourable direction
than I expected, don&rsquo;t you see. Ugly cut this
in the arm; muscles cut through; arteries severed;
requires much attention. Gash in the
face don&rsquo;t look well, but is in no way alarming.
So, old friend, cheer up; you&rsquo;re wounded severely,
but not mortally, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care about it, sir,&rdquo; replied Hearty,
in a more feeble voice than usual. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
care if I had as many holes in me as a sieve;
but to be circumwented in this here &rsquo;bominable
way by a set o&rsquo; rascally pirates arn&rsquo;t to be endured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed Tourniquet, looking
round him anxiously, to see if any of the victors
were within hearing. &ldquo;You must be cautious
of what you say, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I a got a breath o&rsquo; wind in the
canvass I&rsquo;ll tell &rsquo;em they&rsquo;re a set o&rsquo; murderin&rsquo;
thieves,&rdquo; cried the brave old fellow, with all his
remaining strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, I tell you!&rdquo; said the alarmed doctor.
&ldquo;Do you want to have me murdered as
well as yourself? Keep your tongue still, or
every soul of us left alive in the ship will be
massacred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Master Porphyry?&rdquo; asked the
man, languidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe,&rdquo; replied the surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad on&rsquo;t. And Master Zabra, they arn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
a done him no harm, the villains?&rdquo; he inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both are unhurt,&rdquo; said Tourniquet, in a
whisper; &ldquo;and the only way you can keep them
so, is to remain as quiet as possible, and say
nothing to incense your conquerors; and who
knows, but that after you have recovered, you
may have an opportunity of doing them some
service, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thought a&rsquo;most sets me on my
legs again,&rdquo; observed his patient, clasping the
doctor&rsquo;s hand affectionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;here comes Roly
Poly and Loop, at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, massa!&rdquo; cried the black, as he rubbed
his sleepy eyes with one hand, while carrying the
basin of water with the other&mdash;&ldquo;Sockin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;s!
Sockin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;s! Me was takin&rsquo; bit of nap, and
heard nuttin. But who&rsquo;d o&rsquo; ebber tort ob such
obstroplousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Roly Poly,&rdquo; said the
surgeon, as he proceeded to cleanse, to dress,
and bind up the wounds. &ldquo;Hold your tongue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and bring the basin nearer I can&rsquo;t reach it,
don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, massa, me see berry well,&rdquo; replied
the fat cook, heedless of the injunction he had
heard. &ldquo;Sorry for poor Massa Hearty; him
look done to a turn, poor fellar. Him nebber
eat no more puddin&rsquo;; no more soup; no more
meat; no more nuttin, as Roly Poly cooks so
boofliful. Sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir, directly,&rdquo; exclaimed
the doctor, with more emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, massa,&rdquo; responded Roly Poly, and
in a moment afterwards recommenced. &ldquo;Massa
Hearty, him berry good man. Him eat ebry
thin&rsquo; me cook, and ax no &rsquo;pertinent questions.
Nebber turn up him nose when him find bacca
in him soup, or lump o&rsquo; soap in him puddin&rsquo;.
Sorry for him, poor fellar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you hold your tongue, sir?&rdquo; said
Doctor Tourniquet, angrily, &ldquo;and help to
carry the patient to his hammock. Talk to
him on your peril, sir. He requires rest, don&rsquo;t
you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, massa,&rdquo; he replied, assisting to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the wounded man; but he had not proceeded
a yard before his voice was heard
running on as fast as ever. &ldquo;Wo&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say word
more. Hate a fellar as can&rsquo;t hold him tongue
when him told. Al&rsquo;ays talkee, talkee. Mornin&rsquo;
till night him foolis tongue nebber hab no
peace. He go talkee, talkee, to eb&rsquo;ry body;
foolis&rsquo; fellar! Poor man, him want rest; nebber
mind, him not hold him tongue bit more.
Hate a fellar as can&rsquo;t hold him tongue when
him told.&rdquo; And so he continued till he left old
Hearty in his hammock.</p>

<p>The next person the doctor approached was
lying on his back motionless. A brief inspection
seemed sufficient. He shook his head
and passed on towards a man who was supporting
his back against the mast. His face
was pale, and his look haggard, and he seemed
trying with a handkerchief to stop the blood that
was oozing from his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much hurt, I hope?&rdquo; was Doctor
Tourniquet&rsquo;s first inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, I likes to have particular notions
o&rsquo; things in general, as every man as is a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and thinks like a man, should have, and I must
say,&rdquo; said he, slowly and faintly, &ldquo;as I&rsquo;ve a
notion, as I&rsquo;m right down reglarly spiflicated;&rdquo;
and immediately afterwards his head fell upon
his shoulder, his back glided from its support,
and he fell flat upon the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad look that,&rdquo; remarked the surgeon,
kneeling down beside his patient, whom he proceeded
to examine. &ldquo;Bad look&mdash;but &rsquo;tis only
a swoon. He&rsquo;ll recover presently, and in the
mean time I&rsquo;ll look at the wound. Ah! unpromising
case. Dangerous thrust that; don&rsquo;t
like it by any means, but if he is tractable he
may get over it. Well, my friend,&rdquo; exclaimed
Tourniquet, perceiving his patient open his
eyes and look wildly about him, &ldquo;your case
is not so desperate as you imagine; and if you
are attentive to what I tell you, it&rsquo;s very possible
I shall be able to make you safe and sound
again, don&rsquo;t you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After doing what he thought necessary, he
ordered him off to his hammock, and proceeded
to the others. Ardent was found suffering from
severe fracture of the skull; Climberkin had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
fainted from loss of blood, having been wounded
in nearly a dozen different places, but none of
them were dangerous; five others had received
the same rough treatment, who were expected
to recover, and seven more were either dead or
dying. As Doctor Tourniquet was placing a
bandage on the last of his patients, he heard the
pirates, who had been joining in a wild uproar
the whole of the time he had been engaged
upon the wounded, shouting as loud as they
could bawl,&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8a">&ldquo;We stifle ev&rsquo;ry cry,<br /></span>

<p>The surgeon shuddered as he collected together
his instruments, and with a heart full of
anxiety for the fate of himself and his companions
proceeded to his cabin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_IX" id="CHAP_IX">CHAP. IX.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">CAPTAIN DEATH.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> Albatross was within a day&rsquo;s sail of the
shores of Madagascar, and as both Oriel Porphyry,
Zabra, the professor, and the doctor,
appeared desirous of giving their captors no
cause of offence, they were better treated than
they expected to have been. Zabra, more than
all the others, seemed anxious to please the
captain and his lieutenant; and the kindness
of his disposition and the beauty of his music in
a short time had such an influence upon their
savage natures that their former distrust was
completely obliterated, and they entertained
something like a friendly feeling towards him.
But Zabra had evidently some object in the
course he was pursuing. He allowed no opportunity
to escape by which he might win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
their confidence. He was continually doing
some obliging offices for their gratification. He
seemed to take a pleasure in their bold way of
life, joined with them in its praise, and shared
with them in its enjoyments. He handled
their weapons with an air of bravery, and
learned from them to shoot at a mark, and to
cut and thrust with the sword; and there was
such a loftiness in the enthusiasm he manifested
on these occasions, that they invariably treated
him with more respect than any of his fellow
captives. But a close observer might have
noticed that he often turned aside to conceal
the disgust he entertained. When not within
the observation of the pirates, his dark eyes
flashed with indignation, and his beautiful
mouth was compressed into an expression of
scorn. He looked proudly around him, as if
his spirit was exalted above the meaner natures
with whom he was obliged to mingle. He
loathed their fellowship. He abhorred their
ways. And often, when the feeling of disdain
with which he regarded these men seemed
about to break forth into open acknowledgment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
a glance towards the place where Oriel Porphyry
stood, striving to control the contempt
and hatred for the whole crew of ruffians, of
whom he was a prisoner, that kept darting from
his eyes, appeared sufficient to induce him to
redouble his exertions to please the pirate
chiefs.</p>

<p>They were all in the cabin, with the addition
of Scrumpydike, or as he should now be styled,
Lieutenant Rifle, and Log the captain&rsquo;s clerk,
the latter looking twice as important and twice
as conceited as he used to be. Zabra sat leaning
on his harp, near Oriel Porphyry, apparently
absorbed in thought. The doctor and the
professor were disputing upon some metaphysical
subject, as if they had forgotten all
their fears, and cared for nothing but triumphing
over the other. The captain had been
talking with his lieutenant upon the progress of
the ship. Oriel sat proud and abstracted;
and Log was intently engaged in eating and
drinking as much of the good things on the
table as lay within his reach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on as smooth as a mackerel&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
back,&rdquo; said the lieutenant&mdash;&ldquo;every man knows
his dooty, and looks arter it. There&rsquo;s no
flinchers among &rsquo;em; and every one feels in
his nat&rsquo;ral element, cause there&rsquo;s no abominable
honesty among &rsquo;em to corrupt their
morals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you must acknowledge that it&rsquo;s impossible
there can be such a thing as free-will,
don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; said Dr. Tourniquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I acknowledge nothing of the kind, doctor,
I assure you,&rdquo; replied Professor Fortyfolios.
&ldquo;The doctrine of necessity&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo! is my nightingale silent?&rdquo; cried
the captain, unceremoniously interrupting the
logicians. &ldquo;Have you piped all dry&mdash;not a
song left, nor a voice to sing it with? Is
the harp dumb, or the singer sad, that we
haven&rsquo;t heard so much as the ghost of a
tune!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither, noble captain,&rdquo; replied Zabra,
dressing his handsome face in his happiest
smiles. &ldquo;I wait your pleasure for a theme.
Shall it be of love, or of war&mdash;of the pleasures
of wine, or the gladness of gold&mdash;a song of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the hunters amid the melodious forests&mdash;or of
the mariner upon the everlasting sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I might be so bold as to speak for the
cap&rsquo;ain,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, &ldquo;I should say
you might sing any thin&rsquo; you has a mind&mdash;any
thin&rsquo; in the univarsal globe, so as there&rsquo;s
nothin&rsquo; about honesty in it&mdash;a thing as I&rsquo;ve
got a most vartuous abhorrence on. So
chirrup away as soon as you like. I loves to
listen to your toons&mdash;they fills me wi&rsquo; a sort
o&rsquo; all overishness. Arn&rsquo;t it delightful, Master
Log!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delightful&mdash;delightful&mdash;very delightful&mdash;positively
delightful&mdash;upon my word very
superlatively delightful, Mister Scrumpy&mdash;I
mean Lieutenant Rifle,&rdquo; mumbled the little
man, as plainly as his mouth filled full of preserves
would allow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be what is most agreeable to yourself,&rdquo;
said the captain. &ldquo;But I would rather
have something to stir one up a bit&mdash;a sort
of nor-easter&mdash;that will make one&rsquo;s timbers
creak again: none of your lack-a-daisical love
and dove jimcracks&mdash;sink them&mdash;give us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
song that will make one feel as if one was
standing on the tip of one&rsquo;s toes on the tip-top
of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have what you desire, noble
captain,&rdquo; replied Zabra; and, after a stirring
prelude on the harp, sang the following
verses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">With tones that shook the world, replied&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">&lsquo;<strong>We are the free!</strong>&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have no masters on the earth or sea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our home is with the wind&mdash;&lsquo;<strong>We are the free!</strong>&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Loud and long were the commendations with
which the captain and his lieutenant rewarded
the singer. They had listened with as much
gratification as it was possible for them to receive
from such a source, and the bold glances that
darted from their eyes, as the song proceeded,
showed how much they were excited. Even
the conceited spirit of the captain&rsquo;s clerk seemed
moved. He winked his little eyes most valiantly,
and put as much bravery into his smirking
countenance as it could be brought to assume.
Oriel Porphyry regarded the musician, for the
first time, with a look of distrust. To him
there seemed an evident desire of becoming
on more friendly terms with the pirates than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
thought could be desired by an honest nature;
and the ingratitude, as well as the treachery of
such conduct, made Zabra appear to him unworthy
of any kindly feeling. But when their
eyes met, there was such an earnest devotion in
the gaze of Zabra, and so much sincerity of
purpose, that he resolved to defer passing a
condemnation till he had more positive proof of
his unworthiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After such a song as that, I feel a wonderful
deal more social towards you all,&rdquo; observed
the captain; &ldquo;and to show the confidence I
would place in you&mdash;as well as to pass away
the time as agreeably as may be&mdash;if there&rsquo;s no
particular objection, I&rsquo;ll tell you my history
from first to last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do, noble captain; your adventures must
surely be of deep interest to all who love the
inspiring actions of a bold spirit,&rdquo; observed
Zabra. Oriel turned on him a searching look;
but the lustrous eyes upon which he gazed still
seemed filled with the light of truth and affection;
and he knew not what to think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was born a younger brother&mdash;the youngest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of several,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;There was
some property in the family, but it was all carefully
nursed for the heir, who was brought up
in the enjoyment of every indulgence, while the
rest of us picked up our education, and our
existence, as we could. I was least cared for of
all. From my boyhood I was allowed to go
where I pleased, so that I kept out of the way
of my parents and my elder brother; and I was
left to do as I liked, as long as my proceedings
did not inconvenience those affectionate relatives.
As I soon perceived that I got nothing
I required by asking for it, I ever afterwards
managed to acquire what I wanted without
thinking it was necessary to trouble any person
upon the subject. Once I was discovered acting
in this necessary and philosophical manner, and
I was considered guilty of a crime, and most
savagely punished. I cannot say that I was
made conscious of my offence, or that I was ever
brought to acknowledge the justice of its punishment;
but I can most truly affirm, that the
whole proceeding created in me that hatred of
tyranny which led me to be what I am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Our house was by the sea-side, in a wild
and unfrequented part of the coast of Madagascar.
It was a mansion of considerable extent,
ancient, but capable of being put to very good
uses in the hands of a spirited proprietor; and
there were no houses near it, with the exception
of a few cottages on the cliff, belonging to some
smugglers, with whom I had long since made
myself on very good terms. I was then about
twelve years of age, tall and strong, reckless and
daring, perfectly uneducated, as far as school
learning is considered, but wiser than many of
my elders in that really useful knowledge that
proceeds from observation. My intimacy with
the smugglers had taught me many things which
I managed to turn to advantage on several occasions&mdash;particularly
notions affecting the rights
of property, and the legality of resisting the
law. Smarting from the effects of the treatment
I had received, I hastily collected whatever I
considered most valuable, and without waiting
to perform the ceremonies of departure, I took
the shortest way to the cliff, and was the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
evening sailing in a swift cutter far from my
native shores.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My companions early initiated me into all
the mysteries of their craft. I soon acquired a
knowledge of landmarks&mdash;knew every creek
and bay, and sheltered inlet along the shore&mdash;was
familiar with every part of the vessel, its
uses, and management&mdash;learned to understand
the appearances of coming storms&mdash;and could
always tell the best time and place for effecting
a landing upon any required portion of the
coast. I became an active hand, exceedingly
useful, quick, and vigilant; and shared in all
the dangers of my associates, their disappointments,
and successes. My boldness at all times,
my readiness to labour, and the ability with
which I performed all I undertook, made me a
general favourite; and the captain, an old stern
smuggler, rough in his humour, and rather
despotic in his sway, took me under his especial
protection. I was chosen to assist in many
hazardous exploits, in which I was often a principal
figure; for my youth, disarming all suspicion
in those who were on the look-out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
capture the contrabandists, gave me opportunities
for acquiring information as to their proceedings,
which was quickly communicated to
my companions; and we have sometimes managed
matters so well as to be able to store our
cargo in the very house in which our most
vigilant enemy resided. In this way I existed
till I was about seventeen, making voyages from
the island to the continent, and along various
parts of the coast, acquiring a very creditable
knowledge of navigation, and gaining a considerable
degree of information on many other
subjects; and then, for my services and approved
fidelity, I was promoted to be mate in the craft
in which I had been sailing. I had been in
several desperate conflicts with the revenue
officers, but had been so fortunate as to escape
with a few slight scratches; and the excitement
of these affrays had created in me an inclination
to share in more fierce encounters. However,
on one occasion, we were unexpectedly attacked
by very superior numbers, and, although we
defended ourselves with an obstinacy that rendered
the victory dearly bought, we were over-powered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and when I recovered consciousness
after falling on the deck, as I imagined, mortally
wounded, I found myself immured in a gloomy
dungeon, on a charge of smuggling and murder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was accused of murder! I, who had
merely slayed the slayers&mdash;who had only fought
in self-defence&mdash;who in a fray of three to one,
had beaten down some four or five of the hireling
band by whom my associates were being
slaughtered, was loaded with chains, thrust into
a loathsome hole, and condemned to death, as
guilty of the blackest of their black catalogue
of crimes! What miserable bunglers are lawyers
and governments! what wretched blunderers,&mdash;what
empty fools! They create the necessity
for an act, punish with death a deed which
could not be avoided, and then boast of their
wisdom and justice. Much parade, too, they
made about carrying their atrocious sentence
into effect upon one so young. They affected
to be wonderfully pitiful,&mdash;the jury gave their
award in a tone of commiseration, and the judge
pretended to be moved to tears when he passed
the sentence; and then, as many exaggerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
statements had been published of the determination
with which I had resisted being taken,
many humane persons, as the world called them,
visited me in prison, and they brought me what
they said were good books, and talked to me
about things they styled repentance and virtue,
and a few other fooleries. I listened with a patience
that I have since often thought extraordinary;
but I imagined at the time that this
attempt at sympathy might lead to my liberation,
and consequently they always found me
earnestly studying their books, and admirably
attentive to their discourses. But my hopes
were disappointed; I was a fool not to have
known the hypocrites better. They could whine
and cant, but they had no mercy. However,
from a quarter to which I had never looked for
assistance, help came when I least expected it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My jailer was a cold, stern, unfeeling
brute; but he was a brute by profession, and
his disposition was his stock in trade. He had
originally been a housebreaker, or a mean villain
of some kind; and having betrayed his accomplices,
he was rewarded by the miscreants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
whom he served, with a place of trust. For him
bolts and bars seemed to have as much attraction
as if he was a loadstone. His heart appeared
only to throb in the shadow of the thick
walls; and of no music could he be more fond
than the clank of chains and the groans of the
despairing prisoners. Him I cursed every time
we met: but he had a daughter&mdash;a buxom,
light-hearted little creature, whose eye was afloat
in gladness, and whose breast was freighted with
gentle and generous feelings; her olive complexion,
azure eyes, and rich black curling hair,
gave the most charming expression to her face.
She saw me from a window when I was taking
my solitary walk in the gloomy court-yard.
My youthful appearance attracted her attention.
She inquired my history, and as there was
nothing in it of the dastard or the sneak&mdash;nothing
she found ignoble or revolting, she felt
an interest for me which every day grew more
intense. She watched for the coming of the
time when I was allowed to enjoy my daily walks
with increased anxiety; and knowing that I was
doomed to death, her eyes were filled with tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and her heart with tenderness whenever she saw
me. I was ignorant of the feelings I had excited
for several days after they had attained
a power she found it impossible to resist; for as
my execution approached, I strode the narrow
court-yard, hemmed in by towering walls, with
folded arms and eyes upon the ground, muttering
imprecations upon the whole human race;
and beheld not, and thought not of the kind
creature that watched me so anxiously: but one
dull day, the last my judges had allowed me in
this world, I was engaged in making my accustomed
perambulations, when I was roused from
my melancholy reverie by seeing a stone fall at
my feet I looked about me, but did not perceive
whence it came. As I was continuing
my cheerless round, another stone was thrown
close to the place where I stood. I then made
a more careful examination of the few windows
by which I could be overlooked, and at one,
about forty or fifty feet from the ground, I observed
a female figure&mdash;whether she was young
or handsome I could not exactly determine, because
I was unable to distinguish her features,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
but I could have no doubt that she was an angel
when I beheld the end of a strong rope slowly
descend that was evidently falling from her
hand. Before it was within reach, I had run to
grasp it within my eager hands. Soon I
clutched it firmly&mdash;I felt it was tightly fastened
above; long experience in rope-climbing, and a
desperate desire to escape at any hazard, in a
few seconds carried me up to the open window,
where I embraced my deliverer, whom I discovered
to be just the sort of smart-looking little
craft I have described.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pull up the rope,&rsquo; she said anxiously, &lsquo;or
you will be discovered.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost no time in hauling it into the room,
where it was strongly fastened to the bedstead;&mdash;from
this it was immediately made loose and
stowed away into a box, and the window closed.
The chamber in which I found myself was
a small bed-room, possessing all the neatness
and cleanliness in its appearance which distinguish
the sleeping rooms of girls in the first
flush of womanhood. Against the wall was a
bed with linen of a pure white, enclosed in curtains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of the same colour. At one end of the
room a simple toilet was arranged; utensils for
washing were standing in a corner&mdash;a row of
books upon a little cabinet&mdash;a small vase with a
few flowers, two or three chairs, and a table,
composed the furniture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My arms were again round her waist, and
I was showing my gratitude after a fashion I
thought would be most agreeable, when she
raised herself from my arms, smiling, blushing,
and trembling, and fixing on me a look full of
sincerity, purity, and affection, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You may perhaps think me bold&mdash;over
bold; but indeed I could not exist under the
idea that you were about to lose your life. I
was determined to make an effort to save you.
I procured the rope from a manufactory attached
to the prison in which those sentenced
to hard labour are employed, and having well
secured it here, watched my time to drop it
within your reach. I knew that you were left
alone for a short time, and I tried to attract
your attention without exciting the suspicion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
any one. Having provided every thing that was
necessary, and seeing my opportunity, I endeavoured
to make you look up&mdash;I coughed&mdash;I
hemmed&mdash;but you did not move from your position.
I then threw down a stone; you looked
about you, and to my great disappointment and
fear walked on without observing me. My heart
seemed to sink when I thought the opportunity
might be lost, and that on the morrow you
would die. I again threw a stone, and felt the
sweetest pleasure I have ever known when I saw
that you observed me. Quickly and cautiously I
let down the rope; but when I saw you ascend,
and knew that the slightest slip would send you
headlong against the hard stones so far beneath
you, I trembled with fear. You are now safe,
and I am rejoiced. But the greatest caution will
be necessary, or your retreat will be discovered.
By this time your escape is known, and an active
search is being made for you in every direction.
If you wish to retain your life you must
do whatever I desire you. Ha!&rsquo; she exclaimed,
as footsteps were heard approaching, &lsquo;they
come&mdash;get into that bed.&rsquo; I hesitated about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
soiling the sheets with my shoes. &lsquo;In with you
instantly&mdash;there&rsquo;s not a moment to be lost.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I snugly deposited myself under the
bed-clothes, I observed her rapidly put on a
night-gown over the dress she wore, and a cap
upon her head, throw off her shoes, and whispering,
&lsquo;Lie still, if you value your life,&rsquo; she jumped
into the bed, placed my head in her lap as she
sat nearly upright leaning against the pillows,
and arranged the clothes in such a manner that
no one could imagine that the bed contained any
one but herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This had scarcely been done, before I
heard the door open and some one walk into
the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have you heard any one enter your
window, Virgo?&rsquo; asked a gruff voice I readily
recognised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My window, father!&rsquo; exclaimed my angel,
in a tone of the utmost astonishment. &lsquo;How
is it possible any one can get near it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied the old man surlily.
&lsquo;But I left a prisoner a short time ago in the
yard, to let him stretch his legs for the last time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
before we stretched his neck; I returned in a
few minutes, and there was not a glimpse of
him to be seen. I defy a cat to get up the wall.
How he&rsquo;s managed to gi&rsquo; me the slip I can&rsquo;t
guess, unless he jumped out o&rsquo; the keyhole, or
flew in at one o&rsquo; the windows. But you haven&rsquo;t
heard no noise?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not the slightest!&rsquo; said Virgo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Strange&mdash;unkimmonly strange! How
long ha&rsquo; you been awake?&rsquo; inquired her
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;About an hour,&rsquo; replied my angel. &lsquo;I
felt a little better to-day, and was thinking of
getting up when you entered.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard the old man grope under the bed,
and knew that he was exploring every corner,
grumbling and swearing at me at a rate it did
my heart good to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Unkimmonly strange!&rsquo; he exclaimed,
&lsquo;and I shall get sent to the right about if I
can&rsquo;t tell how he&rsquo;s bolted.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I heard him draw aside the curtains,
and I lay as still as a rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What do you want, father?&rsquo; cried Virgo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
very angrily. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s ridiculous for you to
imagine he can be here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Unkimmonly strange!&rsquo; grumbled out the
brute; and having satisfied himself that his prisoner
was not in the room, he shuffled out of it,
growling like a she bear deprived of her cubs.
I could feel Virgo&rsquo;s little heart beating violently
as she listened to the retreating sounds. Neither
of us moved for several minutes. At last, convinced
that the coast was clear, I raised my
head from the clothes, and observed her
face covered with blushes; but as soon as I
moved she made a spring and left me in the
bed alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must remain here till you hear me
leave the room,&rsquo; said she, drawing the curtains
round me; &lsquo;and when I lock the door, change
the clothes you have on for those you will find
laid out for you.&rsquo; I promised obedience, and
with a winning smile she left me to my own
reflections in a pretty considerable puzzlement
concerning the whole affair. Directly I knew
she was gone, I jumped out of my snuggery,
and looked for the change of rigging she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
mentioned. May I be considerably spiflicated
if it wasn&rsquo;t a woman&rsquo;s dress! I must say I
felt but little inclined to the thing; but, thinking
that it might be the only chance I had for
getting out of prison, I stripped, and began
putting on the first thing that came to hand.
It was a sort of shirt, and yet it wasn&rsquo;t a shirt.
It didn&rsquo;t look like the shirt of Jew, Turk, or
Christian. However, after a deal of manouvring,
I slipped it on, and the first thing I discovered
was that both sleeves shortened sail
considerably, and though I tried to haul up the
collar to my neck, I found it wouldn&rsquo;t come
above my shoulders any how, but hung down
with an ugly flap afore and abaft. Well, the
next thing I put my head through was something
of a similar nature, only it came up a
little higher and fell down a little lower, and
was braced up more tight about the body.
After that, I got hold of the strangest piece of
stuff that ever I overhawled. It was shaped
something like a jacket without sleeves or collar,
buttons or button-holes, set round with a number
of slight stiffish spars, one of which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
much broader in the beam than the others, and
there was a running line going through two
rows of holes that kept the thing pretty smartly
together. I found out that there were places
for the arms to go in, and I managed to get it
then over my shoulders. Then I tugged away at
the running line till I had got it through all the
holes, and by pulling and hauling, twisting and
turning, I made all fast; but the spars pinched
me most confoundedly, and the big one stood
out astern of my back bone in the oddest
manner possible. Then there were a few more
things into which I found my way more easily,
and when I was regularly rigged out, I took a
look at myself at the glass; and I will say, a
more ridiculous craft never ventured afloat that
what I appeared to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was amusing myself with the figure I
cut, when I heard a footstep&mdash;the key turned
in the lock, and Virgo entered, fastening the
door after her. As soon as she clapped eyes
upon me, they began to twinkle famously, and,
without any ceremony, she opened upon me as
complete a laugh as ever I heard. And she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
had good reason, for I&rsquo;d got a hump on my
back as big as a dromedary&rsquo;s, owing to my
having put the thing with the spars on stern
foremost; and I&rsquo;d managed to twist every thing
out of its proper place, because I was ignorant
of the right way of putting them on. Well, she
made no more to do, but just took me to pieces
as if I&rsquo;d been a baby, and put every thing to
rights, laughing all the time; yet as modest as
any she creature that ever lived. Then she
made me wash my face; and afterwards she
combed my hair, curled it, and put a sort of
turban on my head; and then, with a triumphant
smile, she bade me look in the glass. I did&rsquo;nt
know myself. I looked as complete a girl as
ever walked in petticoats. My complexion had
been rather browned by the sun, and my limbs
had little of the feminine about them; but notwithstanding
these things I appeared more
womanish than previously I thought it possible
I could have been made. As yet I had no
whiskers, and my beard did&rsquo;nt give me any
particular deal of trouble; so that, on that score,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
there was little that could betray that I was
sailing under false colours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Virgo seemed to enjoy the change she had
produced amazingly. She walked about me
with her eyes filled with pleasure, as if delighting
in the contemplation of her own work;
while I, scarcely able to understand the whole
drift of the proceedings, looked a little bothered
and mystified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now if any of our people do see you,&rdquo; said
she, cheerfully, &ldquo;I do&rsquo;nt think it at all likely
that they would suspect who you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there was I, a wild, daring, uncontrollable
youth, living locked up in the bed-room
of an innocent little creature some years younger
than myself. She brought me every thing that
she thought likely to render my confinement
more endurable, and endeavoured, by a thousand
affectionate ways, to make me forget that
I was deprived of my liberty. To get out of
the prison, she told me, was impossible at
present, as every person entering and going out
underwent strict examination; but I had some
idea that she said this to keep me where I was;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and though I loved her as well as I was able to
love, for having saved my life, the sort of existence
I led was not one my spirit could long
endure. I can say, most solemnly, that she
remained as pure in heart and mind as it was
possible for the purest to be. She allowed my
caresses&mdash;she returned them&mdash;but there was
such a modesty in her spotless nature, that it
repelled the slightest exhibition of passion. At
night she would leave the room while I undressed,
and, when I was in bed, she would
come and lay by my side upon the bed in her
clothes, and, with her arms round my neck, and
her cheek upon mine, we went to sleep. When
she made her toilet, she would draw the curtains
round me, kiss me, and tell me not to move;
and her innocence and gentleness seemed to
exert upon me such a spell, that I did&rsquo;nt dare
move an inch, or make the slightest attempt to
watch her proceedings. Extraordinary was the
care with which this guileless creature endeavoured
to avoid a discovery. She watched over
me as if I was her treasure, and appeared as if
she knew no enjoyment but in my presence. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
know not what she would have made of me in
time, for I was as a child in her hands; but I
began to grow restless at this imprisonment,
and was seeking an opportunity to bring it to a
termination. This was brought about sooner
than I expected, and, in a manner, too, I did
not at all anticipate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, while we were enjoying ourselves
in our usual quiet manner, we heard footsteps
approaching the door. She had just time to
throw some work, upon which she had been
employed, into my lap, and tell me to sew away
as well as I could, when the door opened, and
her father entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hullo, who&rsquo;s that young woman?&rsquo; he inquired,
rather surlily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s only a person come to help me on
with some work, father,&rsquo; his daughter replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he exclaimed, scrutinising my appearance
very earnestly. Now, I was never
any great hands at hemming and stitching: I
held the needle like an oar, and pricked my
fingers more than I did the stuff I was required
to sew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is she a good work-woman?&rsquo; asked the
old man, approaching nearer to me, and watching
my awkward labours with more attention
than I desired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Capital, father!&rsquo; said my angel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; he responded, in the same
gruff tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do good work-women usually hold the
needle in the left hand?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, she works left-handed,&rsquo; replied
Virgo. Catch a woman off her guard if you
can, thought I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; exclaimed the old fellow; and
then, while I was busily engaged in sewing my
fingers together, and before I could have the
slightest idea of what he intended, he snatched
the turban off my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, ah! you young gallows-bird!&rsquo; he
cried, in a tone of exultation; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found
you, have I? I thought you couldn&rsquo;t have
given me the slip completely. But come
along,&rsquo; he added, as he clutched me forcibly by
the arm. &lsquo;You shall be hanged this time, be
assured.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not if I can help it, old boy!&rsquo; said I, as
I tripped up his heels; then, snatching a knife
that lay at hand, I put my knee upon his chest,
and held the blade over his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Call assistance, you hussey!&rsquo; screamed the
prostrate jailer to his daughter, who seemed in
an agony of terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you speak another word, I&rsquo;ll cut your
throat,&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;And you, Virgo, if you don&rsquo;t
wish your father to be killed before your
face, which I shall be obliged to do to save
myself, you will hand me some rope, with
which I can bind him in such a manner as
will prevent his giving the alarm before I have
escaped.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, save him!&rsquo; she exclaimed earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Quick, quick!&rsquo; I cried. The rope was
brought, and I tied the old boy down, safe and
sound, and gagged his mouth as he was muttering
curses on us both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is only one way of escaping from
this place,&rsquo; she observed with considerable
anxiety in her features, as she saw me preparing
to depart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How? let me know it instantly, for I
have not a moment to lose,&rsquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will be stopped at the gate, unless I
am with you,&rsquo; she added, gazing on me with
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, come then, sweet one,&rsquo; said I,
hastily; &lsquo;you will lead a dog&rsquo;s life of it, if you
remain here; and I will do the best I can for
you when you are out of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looked grateful and affectionate; instantly
arranged my dress, which had become
disordered by the struggle; hastily collected
a few valuables; and, opening the door, we went
out together. I have lived a good many years
since then, but I must acknowledge that I never
lived so happily as I did in the little bed-room of
the jailer&rsquo;s daughter. I was striding along the
narrow passages of the prison, when she stopped
me, and told me that if I proceeded at that rate,
I could not avoid being discovered, and bade
me, as near as I could, imitate her manner of
walking; so I immediately began to tread the
ground as if I was picking my way over cherry
stones, and after threading a multitude of dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
passages, we arrived at the gate, where, being in
company with Virgo, I excited no suspicion,
and with merely a word or two of greeting from
the attendants, we passed into the street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was now in the open air; I had at last
escaped the stifling atmosphere of a prison; and
any one, having been used to the freedom of
the wide seas and the excitement of a life of
enterprise, who has been immured for months
within stone walls, enduring the dreary monotony
of imprisonment, may imagine what were
my feelings when I found myself again in the
enjoyment of my liberty; but what to do now
I was free was the next consideration. The
dress I wore could not conceal me long, especially
when, as I knew must be the case, the
manner of my escape was made public; and as
it would be unsafe for me to remain in the
neighbourhood, I saw that it might encumber
my flight; and what to do with Virgo was another
puzzle: she who had risked so much for
me I felt ought not to be abandoned; but I
knew it would be impossible for us to remain
together. I told her of this, but she begged so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
hard to be allowed to remain with me, and
seemed to despair so completely at the thought
of our separation, that I resolved at any rate
that we should not part company till all hope of
remaining near each other with any safety was
destroyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this dilemma, I thought of a smuggler&rsquo;s
widow, who carried on a little bit of a trade in
the outskirts of the town, to whom I had done
many a good turn out of regard for her husband,
a brave-spirited fellow, who was shot by
my side, while defending a cargo from the
greedy clutches of the revenue rascals, and to
her humble abode I bent my way. Glad, indeed,
was she to see me, when I made myself
known to her. I never knew a creature who
appeared more delighted; and having told her
how I was situated, actively she sat about
insuring my safety. The next day, as I had
anticipated, the particulars of my escape, with
many exaggerations, were published all over
the country. A price was set upon my head,
and every hole and corner was searched, in the
hope of finding the fugitive. I never felt more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
satisfaction than when I cut the petticoats. I
was always kicking my shins against them.
They hurt my spirit, and almost stifled my
manhood. I was now dressed in a suit of
sober brown, like a young apprentice, and I
passed as the widow&rsquo;s nephew; serving in her
shop, and going about her errands, as knowingly
as if I had been a shop-boy all my life.
For my sake the widow paid every possible
attention to Virgo, who seemed never easy but
when I was with her. The fear of discovery
was always in her heart. She was restless,
anxious, and melancholy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After a few months of this kind of life I
grew quite as tired of it as I had been of my
existence in the little bed-room of the gaoler&rsquo;s
daughter. I longed for the freedom of the
open sea. I felt an unconquerable desire to
return to a life of enterprise. The chase, I
thought, must by this time have been given up
in despair; and, consequently, that now I
might steer my course wherever I pleased. As
I was reflecting upon the most available means
of satisfying my desires, while alone pursuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
some employment in the widow&rsquo;s little shop,
who should enter, to inquire his direction to a
neighbouring street, but the very last person I
desired to see&mdash;Virgo&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No! surely! humph! ha! Yes, it must
be. You rascal, I&rsquo;ve found you, at last,&rsquo; exclaimed
the old brute, as he approached, and
seized me by the collar. I had a wooden
mallet in my hand at the moment; I gave it a
swing round, and the gaoler fell senseless at my
feet. Without stopping to acquaint any one
with what I had done, I ran out of the house;
and bending my way to the water-side, I inquired
if any ship was on the point of sailing,
and hearing that a merchant-vessel was waiting
for a few hands before she started, I presented
myself on board, offered my services, was engaged,
and was sailing, far out of the reach of
all pursuit, the same evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our voyage was a long one. We were
bound to China: the crew were a medley of
various nations picked up at random. The captain
was proud and tyrannical; ignorant of his
duty, yet continually interfering with those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
were better seamen than himself. His mate was
a mean-spirited sycophant, who exceeded his
superior in insolence and tyranny. Punishments
were frequent, and often without any
thing like sufficient cause; and the men became
discontented, grumbled, and at last began to
threaten vengeance on their oppressors. To
add to their causes of complaint the provisions
fell short, which was entirely owing to the mismanagement
of the captain&mdash;the men were
placed on short allowance; and their officers, instead
of endeavouring to render the privation as
endurable as possible, by their arrogance and
oppression seemed to seek every opportunity of
increasing their miseries. Secret meetings
were held in the ship&mdash;plans of resistance were
discussed by the crew&mdash;and every day made an
open revolt among them more probable. Neither
the captain nor his mate appeared to entertain
the least apprehension of danger, for they
did not alter their behaviour in the slightest degree.
In the conspiracies which had been agitated
I had always been an active hand&mdash;I
counselled the boldest measures, and advised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
their early adoption; but although my ability
in seamanship was generally acknowledged,
they had no knowledge of my character, and
wanted what they called a more experienced
leader. The mutiny broke out, however, at last,
before all our plans were ripe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had committed some slight offence, so
trifling, that men of any sense would have
passed it over; but I was seized upon by the
despots, and sentenced to a hundred lashes. I
was rather a favourite with all, and a loud murmur
of discontent arose amongst the crew as
soon as my sentence became known; but their
cries were unheeded. I was being lashed to
the grating, and both the tyrants were swearing
at and threatening the men for not showing
more alacrity in proceeding with my punishment,
when the mate was felled to the deck with a
handspike, and the captain was whipped up in
the arms of a tall negro and hurled overboard.
All who opposed would have met with similar
treatment; but there was no opposition, nor was
there any commiseration for the fate of the men
who had been killed. I was speedily released<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
from my disagreeable situation, and then we
commenced overhauling the cargo, which we
found valuable, and examining the stores, which
were pronounced inadequate for the wants of a
long voyage. Many plans were agitated by which
we might govern our future conduct. Some
were for sailing for Borneo, and there disposing of
the ship and cargo for the benefit of the crew;
others were for steering direct for Sumatra;
there disposing of the cargo, and sail from thence
to enjoy ourselves with the proceeds in one or
other of the islands in the Indian Ocean. I advised,
that as we were close upon the Philippine
islands, where we should meet with plenty of
customers for what we did not require, and
could easily purchase from them whatever we
wanted, it was not advisable to risk a longer
voyage. We could there dispose of that portion
of the cargo that found the readiest market,
have the ship disguised, and fitted with as many
guns as she could carry, and afterwards commence
war against all the rich vessels we met
from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the bold spirits among the crew applauded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
this proposal; but the timorous dispositions
saw in it too much danger, and gave it
their opposition; however, when it was found
that the provisions would not last a longer voyage,
part of the plan was agreed upon, and the
helm was turned towards Mindanao. I was
ambitious of being chosen captain, for which
office I knew myself better fitted than any of
my companions, but I was disappointed; and a
man rather more than thirty, a native of Mozambique,
on the southern coast of Africa, was
promoted to the command, who was bold enough
for a leader in an attack of boarders, but had
not the seamanship that could conduct a vessel
through every variety of danger. I concealed
my disappointment as well as I could, determining
to wait my opportunity till I could put forth
my claims in a way that should insure their
being properly acknowledged. I had some
staunch friends among my associates, and these
were the bravest of the whole crew. I saw
that with a few more of the same kind nothing
could prevent the realisation of my ambition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We anchored in a noble bay in the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
I have mentioned; and as I was thought, even by
the captain, to know more of the value of the
things than any of the others, I was sent ashore,
in company with two or three messmates considerably
older than myself, to arrange about
the sale. We were dressed as merchants; and
as no one appeared to have any suspicion of our
real characters, we soon negotiated, upon what
we thought very favourable terms, a sale of
a great portion of our merchandise. A division
having been made of the proceeds, here most
of those upon whom I could not depend left us,
a proceeding with which I was exceedingly well
satisfied; and my intentions were put into execution
with regard to the alterations required in
the ship to make her fit for piratical expeditions,
that gratified me in a similar degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While our vessel was changing her appearance,
I was leading a life of indolent luxury.
The part of the island near which we had
anchored abounded in the most delightful
kind of scenery. Plains, rich with vegetation&mdash;forests
of gigantic trees, bending beneath their
heavy crops of tempting fruit&mdash;and a sky over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
head always looking down with a warm delicious
aspect&mdash;and there were other enjoyments
in which I also had an abundant share. I
found hearts not less warm than their climate,
and looks not less glowing than their skies.
To these pleasures I abandoned myself with all
the heedlessness of such a wild unbridled nature
as mine had always been. I revelled in a continual
intoxication of the passions. I was
entranced in a perpetual dream of luxurious
enjoyment. But madly as I plunged into the
dissipation with which I was surrounded, I
never was so happy as I was while I remained
in the little bed-room of the gaoler&rsquo;s daughter;
and I have often found myself turning away
from the voluptuous beauties whose ready smiles
I had purchased, to think of the innocent love
of the simple Virgo, who had shown to me such
wonderful disinterestedness in her devotion.
But these thoughts were of little avail, and why
should they be otherwise? Man was made to
enjoy the pleasures within his reach, or why
were those pleasures created to tempt him with
their near approximation? I did nothing more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
therefore, in giving loose to the passions that
formed part of my nature, than was natural, and
the excesses into which they led were forced
upon me as things impossible to be avoided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in this island I first formed the
acquaintance of Master Boor, who was then a
clerk in a merchant&rsquo;s counting-house. We met
at some place of licentious indulgence. A similarity
of tastes soon made us intimate&mdash;and
a certain quickness of comprehension possessed
by both made each familiar with the character
of the other. I found him a deep, designing,
low minded wretch, whose sole object was the
accumulation of money by any means that
cunning could devise or cruelty execute. He
thought me an admirable agent to assist in
carrying his plans into execution, and believing
that he would be particularly useful in my
pursuits, I lent myself in some measure to forward
his designs. His true disposition he had
well concealed from the people by whom he was
surrounded, who placing unbounded confidence
in his integrity, by degrees gave up to him
nearly the entire management of their business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
To him at all times I disposed of my plunder,
and although I found him an avaricious scoundrel,
over-reaching me in every way, he was too
necessary to be quarrelled with. Chiefly by
his assistance I got intelligence of what desirable
ships were on the neighbouring seas, where
they were to be found, and how the vessels of
war protecting their traffic were best to be
avoided; and soon as ever our ship could be
got into proper trim for our purposes, we commenced
a career of plunder which in a few
years made us the terror and scourge of that
part of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had made myself so useful to the captain
by this time, that he had named me his second
in command, and intrusted me with the principal
duties of the ship, with the idea of so concealing
his own inefficiency; but I was not to
be satisfied with a second place, when I knew
the first was my right; and having now attained
to the full maturity of manhood, and having
about me a numerous crew of brave fellows, the
majority of whom I knew were in my interest,
I set about devising a plan by which my ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
ideas might be satisfied. The man was of
a fiery temper when roused, and hesitated not
to commit any action to rid himself of an
enemy. I watched my opportunity, picked a
quarrel with him:&mdash;he attacked me with his
usual violence, and after a short struggle I slew
him on the deck. It was a fair stand-up fight,
and none of the men attempted to interfere.
After the body had been cast into the sea, I
was unanimously voted into the vacant command:
some through fear, and some through
choice, desired that I should become their captain;
but I cared not what they thought, or
what they felt. I resolved, now I had obtained
the superiority I wanted, to allow no obstacles
that were likely to prevent me from retaining
it. It was a difficult thing to get a band of fierce
unruly men to obey the commands of one of
themselves, but I knew that the strong will only
be ruled by the strongest, and that fear was the
surest chain to control the reckless; so I soon
began to show them I was not to be trifled with&mdash;I
made them pay the most implicit obedience
to my commands&mdash;well rewarded those whom I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
found most tractable, and punished with instant
death all who attempted resistance. In this
way I created around me a set of daring spirits,
ready to obey my slightest wish, and willing to
follow wherever I chose to lead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this time Boor had become a partner
in the house whose servant he had previously
been, and seemed to live in much estimation
with his coadjutors; but he had not been above
a year in this promotion, when both his partners
died suddenly in a way best known to himself;
and as he produced a will, in which he was made
sole heir to their property, he took possession
of the whole business, and went on with his
usual cunning and treachery, accumulating
money as fast as he could. I continued to live,
sometimes enjoying myself like a prince on
shore, at other times, when afloat, striking
terror wherever I went. But in that part of
the world, I found that this state of things could
not last much longer. The daring manner with
which our proceedings were carried on, the
boldness with which we plundered, and the
fierceness with which we destroyed, while it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
created alarm among the merchants, forced the
governments to use something like activity in
their measures for our extermination. Ships of
war were sent after us in every direction: we
were chased from sea to sea, and from coast to
coast, with a rapidity that allowed us no repose;
and every day, at considerable disadvantages, we
were obliged to fight our way wherever we
went, continually losing some of the bravest of
the crew, and not being allowed a single opportunity
of gaining any prizes. However, by
the intelligence I received from Boor, I managed
to elude being taken; and as he found that
suspicions of his true character were afloat on
the island, and that arrangements were being
made to take him into custody upon charges
he would have found it difficult to answer, he
secretly and suddenly disposed of the greater
portion of his property; and by an arrangement
with me, he embarked on board my ship as soon
as I could with safety appear on the coast, when,
without losing a moment&rsquo;s time, we steered direct
for the southern coast of Africa; and soon
after my landing him at his desire at Caffreton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
he commenced business there as a broker of
merchandise, with a great portion of which he
was supplied through me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I now began to feel rather desirous of knowing
what had become of Virgo; for in all the
scenes of danger and of pleasure in which I had
since moved, I could not banish from my mind the
cheerful, pure, and devoted little creature, who
had risked so much to preserve my existence.
Many years had passed by; I had become more
stern and savage: knowing that every man&rsquo;s hand
was raised against me, I showed but little mercy
when any of the class to which I was opposed
fell into my power; but though I was continually
the daring leader in scenes of bloodshed,
and in all animal gratifications upon
every fitting opportunity abandoned myself
with no other thought than to get as much pleasure
into the moment as the moment could
possess, I had frequently found myself looking
back to what always appeared my happiest
hours, to the innocent enjoyments I had known
in the little bedroom of the gaoler&rsquo;s daughter;
and finding myself, comparatively speaking, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
near Madagascar, and knowing that I was so
altered by time and climate that it was impossible
for me to be recognised by any of my
old acquaintances, I resolved to visit the old
town, and try if I could discover the only being
in the world for whom I ever entertained any
thing like affection. The external character of
the ship was always so mercantile, that the most
knowing seamen were deceived by her; and as
whenever I entered a port I took especial caution
to make the men and every part of the
vessel within observation disguised in such a
manner that no suspicion could be entertained,
I felt satisfied that from that quarter there was
also no occasion for apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found the old widow in her old place&mdash;she
was the same as ever. I was welcomed and
wondered at as soon as I discovered to her who
I was. I found her, but the dear one I had
sought I never found. When she was told
that I had left her, her heart seemed smitten
with a sudden melancholy&mdash;her cheerfulness
departed for ever&mdash;and day after day she pined
till her smile was turned into darkness, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
pure spirit floated among breakers, struck,
struggled, and went down. The news almost
made me mad. I became as savage as a tiger;
the last touch of humanity seemed to have fled
from my nature; and from that moment I commenced
an unrelenting warfare against my fellow-men.
I was right. They had no sympathies
for me, and why should I have any for
them? All sought my destruction, and I destroyed
all in return. But wherever I looked
around the world I observed the same fierce
enmity prevailing. All were waging war upon
each other. The powerful crushed the weak&mdash;the
rich trampled on the poor&mdash;and the idle
preyed upon the labour of the industrious. It
was well for them to boast of such things as
justice and mercy, and love and virtue, and
charity and religion: I laughed at them and
their fine catalogue of hypocrisies. I saw the
thin veil of spotless lace with which they sought
to conceal their own rottenness and filth. I
scorned their hollow professions; I hated their
mean vices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quickly left a place that had become detestable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and for the first time since my boyhood
I visited that part of the coast near which was
situated the dwelling of my family. Here I
learned that my affectionate parents had long
since mingled with the dust, leaving their hopeful
heir, hated by all the neighbourhood for his
detestable deeds and tyrannical disposition, the
inheritor of their property. Finding that he
had committed offences that deserved summary
punishment, without asking his permission I
brought him to trial: his guilt was undeniable;
and I thought the ends of justice would be best
accomplished if I turned him over for punishment
to the people whom he had so cruelly
wronged. What they did with him I do not
exactly know, but I never heard of him afterwards.
I then took possession of the old house,&mdash;had
many alterations made in it, the more
completely to fit it for my purpose&mdash;managed
the approaches so as to render it inaccessible
to all but friends, and used it as an asylum after
my piratical expeditions. By Boor&rsquo;s assistance
I carried on the same game which had made
me famous in the Indian Seas, and with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
same effect. The mere mentioning my name
struck terror into the hearts of merchant-captains
and their crews&mdash;all the feeble were
frightened, and all the bold were in pursuit.
But Boor by this time had become rich, and
fancying that his connection with me was too
hazardous to be continued any longer, after
some fresh act of daring upon my part, when
the whole coast seemed up in arms against me,
as I ascertained, he gave secret information as
to where I was most likely to be found. An
expedition of several well armed ships was immediately
fitted out, of which I had timely notice
from another quarter, and sought to avoid;
but when I thought I had given them the slip,
and was bearing down upon what I imagined was
a rich merchant vessel, I discovered that I was
approaching into the very net from which I was
most desirous of escaping; and was obliged to
put up every stitch of canvass, and make use of
every man&oelig;uvre in the hope of getting away.
My ship was a splendid sailer; but I found myself
held in chase by vessels whose powers were
equal to hers, and I should have inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
been taken or killed in the struggle: but in the
night a terrific storm came on; and as I was
creeping along-shore, with the hope of avoiding
the ships in chase, knowing that they would
keep out at sea, she struck on a rock, in a
short time went to pieces, and of all the crew
none were saved but myself, my lieutenant, and
my clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This catastrophe would have been enough
to have damped the energies of any man; but
I was made of different stuff. I had got some
money about me, which I knew would be a
letter of recommendation in any part of the
world; so when we got on shore we lived in some
sort of style, and there I fell in with one Captain
Compass&mdash;a foolish, communicative creature,
from whom I learned that he was going
to Columbus, with the intention of endeavouring
to get the command of one of the ships belonging
to Master Porphyry the rich merchant, to
whom he had strong letters of recommendation.
By mutual consent we travelled together, and
at the first favourable moment I took charge of
his letters, and my lieutenant took charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
him. I lost no time in presenting myself with
my credentials to Master Porphyry, by whom I
was placed in the command of the Albatross&mdash;a
vessel which, from the first moment I saw it, I
had the strongest inclination to appropriate. I
found that nothing could be done during the
voyage to Africa; but upon my arrival at Caffreton
I sought my old associate Boor, by whom
I had been given over as lost, but whom the
prospect of getting a rich cargo on the most advantageous
terms induced to assist me as far as
he was able. When my arrangements were
completed, I called upon him, as he thought, to
settle about the amount to be paid, but as I
knew to put into execution a plan I had devised
to punish him for his treachery. I was shown
as usual into a little room at the back of his office,
in which I had noticed a large iron cupboard
wherein he secured his valuables. He
kept haggling with me some time, and at last
the price was agreed upon, and he gave me the
money. Before he had the slightest suspicion
of my intentions, I suddenly caught hold of him
by the throat till I had squeezed the breath out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of his wretched body: his struggles were feeble,
and he hadn&rsquo;t time to utter a cry. I quickly
thrust the lifeless carcass into the iron cupboard,
locked it, put the key in my pocket,
and walked away as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what followed after I got on board,
none of you here want being told; and I have
only to add to those who are now my prisoners,
that Master Porphyry I keep alive, because I
consider it my interest to do so, and tell him,
that if he falls into my plans he will insure his
own safety and that of his companions; if he
opposes them, he must expect to meet with the
fate of hundreds who have preceded him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry looked proudly, and made
no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, captain, that is the most interesting
&rsquo;munication that ever was&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it, Master
Log?&rdquo; inquired the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting&mdash;interesting!&rdquo; exclaimed the
captain&rsquo;s clerk, aroused from his sleep, and
rubbing his drowsy eyes&mdash;&ldquo;most interesting&mdash;most
cruelly interesting&mdash;upon my word most
ferociously interesting, Mister Scrum&mdash;I mean
Lieutenant Rifle.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAP_X" id="CHAP_X">CHAP. X.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="f8">THE PIRATE&rsquo;S RETREAT.</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">The</span> Albatross was creeping up the Mozambique
channel, with her captain at her helm, who
showed an extraordinary degree of knowledge
of the coast, piloting the ship through narrow
passages lined with breakers, and surrounded
by stupendous rocks, amid which the waves
kept lashing each other into foam on every
side. Threading the mazes of this intricate
labyrinth, the ship was borne through a long
opening between huge masses of granite, in
which it seemed utterly impossible for any vessel
to keep afloat, and then entered a snug little
bay, perfectly concealed from observation by
passing ships by the surrounding rocks, and
there she cast anchor. Boats were let down,
and the prisoners, well guarded, were taken
ashore. Upon landing, they found themselves
upon a clean shingly beach, leading to a soil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
exceeding verdure, where trees of immense proportions
bowed their luxuriant heads to the
passing breeze; and parasitical and creeping
plants, of wonderful variety and beautiful appearance,
twisted and twined among the rocks,
and over the gigantic trees. There the bread-fruit
tree spread its welcome burden, and the
raven palm held out its green abundance.
Further on, the cocoa-nut bent down its branches,
overladen with their grateful fruit&mdash;while limes,
oranges, tamarinds, and figs, on every side, offered
their refreshing stores. Among the flowering
plants, the most remarkable was the <i>anramatico</i>,
whose bell-shaped flower contained nearly
half a gallon of water, always pure and fresh,
and whose excellent fruit was formed like a cup
and cover. Among these, several flamingoes
were noticed, in their scarlet liveries, like sentinels
upon duty&mdash;and troops of gaudy paroquets
were chattering among the branches of
the trees. There the green lizard ran along
the bank, and the grey chameleon glided among
the boughs.</p>

<p>The party proceeded on through fields of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
maize, rice, sugar-canes, yams, and bananas,
into a thick forest of gloomy trees, from among
which they disturbed the wild hogs at their
roots, and the monkeys in their branches&mdash;occasionally
they would meet with a porcupine, or
a babyroussa&mdash;and more than once they came
upon a troop of bisons, or a stray zebra, who
were munching the green herbage. Flocks of
pigeons were flying wildly about, and innumerable
singing birds were endeavouring to create
a living harmony in the forest. After proceeding
in this manner about a mile, the captain
and his followers began to ascend a steep rock,
covered with every species of tropical verdure,
and they passed, with increasing difficulty, from
precipice to precipice till they came to an immense
black chasm that yawned fearfully before
them. Over this there was no passing.
Here the captain fired a pistol, and the report,
reverberating through the hollow rocks, was
repeated with a thousand echoes, that called up
from the dreary depths of the abyss flights of
monstrous bats, several hawks, and two or three
gigantic eagles, that whirled round and round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
over the heads of the intruders, and then disappeared
in various directions. Immediately
afterwards a troop of armed men, of the dark
olive complexion of the country, clad in loose
tunics, and lower garments reaching to the knee&mdash;with
naked legs and arms&mdash;were seen descending
the rock on the other side; and, as
soon as they noticed the captain, they set up a
cry of welcome, and danced and shouted in
joyful recognition.</p>

<p>They immediately threw a thick rope across
the chasm, which was made fast to a neighbouring
tree&mdash;another rope was fastened within a
foot of it&mdash;over these, two strong hoops were
sent across, connected with each other, and
affixed to a strong rope, and by resting the
body within these, and holding the ropes by the
arms, each individual of the party was dragged
in safety to the other side of the rock. From
thence they proceeded along a narrow path cut
in the rock, winding upwards to the top, and
then descended on the other side, where, at the
foot of the descent, they beheld a low, heavy,
antique mansion, strongly built, and almost hid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
among plantations of the raven palm. Here
they were joined by several more of the same
sort of men as those by whom they had been
assisted over the chasm; and the delight they
evinced at the return of their master was equally
noisy and wild as that previously shown by their
companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the captain,
turning to his prisoners, &ldquo;welcome to my
humble abode. It does not look so imposing as
the mansions to which some of you have been
accustomed, but I think you will find in it every
thing likely to make your captivity endurable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your abode looks most invitingly, noble
captain,&rdquo; observed Zabra, apparently much
delighted; &ldquo;and if the interior accord with the
promise of what we see, I doubt much if either
of us will have any desire to quit its attractions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry glanced angrily upon his
friend, and again a suspicion of treachery entered
his mind; but his attention was soon
directed into another channel, when, upon entering
the house, he found it fitted up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
most sumptuous style of Eastern taste. The
spacious rooms were floored with marble, that
threw a delicious coolness into the atmosphere,
and flowers growing out of beautiful vases filled
the air with fragrance. Here were ottomans
and couches to attract the indolent&mdash;and at
the open windows the grapes hung in clusters
to tempt the thirsty. All the furniture was
costly and elegant, and every room breathed an
air of luxurious enjoyment.</p>

<p>Here the pirate chief kept his prisoners closely
watched, but allowed them every comfort that
his house afforded. The wounded men were
carefully attended to; and through the skill of
Doctor Tourniquet, and the benefit they derived
from strolling about in the neighbourhood,
which they were allowed to do when well
guarded, they became convalescent. Zabra was
more than ever in favour with the captain, and,
by the same attractions, gained the good will of
every one of the wild gang whom he commanded.
They let him go where he pleased,
and do as he pleased; and he had excited so
complete a confidence in his captors, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
left him to roam about unguarded at all times,
when the rest were watched with the most
jealous care. Not only was he allowed this
indulgence, but they showed him all the secrets
of their retreat; conducted him into subterranean
caves, where piles of the most valuable
merchandise were stored, and led him into the
vaults where their ammunition and weapons, in
great abundance, were laid up ready for use.
He also went several times with them from the
house to the ship, till he could find his way
alone.</p>

<p>Oriel Porphyry was not long allowed to
remain in ignorance of the conditions upon
which his life and the lives of his companions
might be preserved; and these were, that he
should sail in the Albatross on his destination,
as if nothing had transpired&mdash;negotiate a sale
of the merchandise it contained&mdash;and betray
into the captain&rsquo;s hands such of his father&rsquo;s
ships as he might meet with on his voyage.
These proposals were immediately spurned; but
the entreaties of Doctor Tourniquet and the professor,
and his own consideration for the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
men whose safety was in his hands, at last
induced him to adopt a temporising policy. He
seemed to listen with some attention to the
captain&rsquo;s propositions, and, as the pirates thought,
not unwillingly; but he was only waiting for
an opportunity to attempt some desperate
struggle, by which the liberation of himself and
friends might be effected. This apparent acquiescence
gained for him a greater degree of
liberty, and a less strict surveillance, than he
had previously known; and then, when they
found themselves entirely free from observation,
Zabra and he often met together, and had long
and earnest conferences. Zabra, too, took every
opportunity to converse with Hearty and the
others, who had recovered from their wounds,
and all seemed to listen to him with extraordinary
interest. These men had intimated to the
captain, that they had no objection to join his
band on condition that they were not separated
from Master Porphyry; and as they associated
with the pirates, with every appearance of
sociality and sincerity, the captain, though he
did not then allow their request, left them in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
less guarded state than he had previously done.
Then Zabra&rsquo;s communications with them became
more frequent, and their conferences with one
another appeared to increase in interest.</p>

<p>One day, when the captain, and about half
his band, had gone out shooting wild hogs in
the adjacent woods, the rest of the pirates, with
their prisoners, were mingled together, talking
and joking, and amusing themselves among the
trees at the back of the house, and Hearty was
looking anxiously every now and then as if he
was waiting for some one to join his party. His
companions also shared in the laugh, and in the
sport which was proceeding, but it seemed as if
their thoughts were otherwise employed. They
were evidently inattentive to what was going
on around them. They evinced a restlessness&mdash;an
anxiety&mdash;an impatience not characteristic
of men engaged in amusement; and now and
then looks passed between them in which there
appeared more meaning than was visible to the
others. But the pirates heeded not these things.
They thought only of the sport in which they
were occupied; and being well armed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
much out-numbering their prisoners, who were
without weapons, they had not the slightest
fear or expectation of their attempting an escape.
At last the boy Loop was observed turning the
corner of the house, carrying a heavy bundle on
his head. As soon as he was seen, Hearty and
his companions hastily put their right arms into
the upper part of their vests, each produced a
pistol, and in an instant eight or ten of the
pirates fell dead or wounded at their feet. With
a shout, the sailors rushed towards the boy Loop,
whose bundle, containing weapons, was soon appropriated,
and then, amid yells and imprecations,
cheers and shouts, there commenced a war of extermination
between the two parties. The pirates
were taken quite by surprise, and were put in
confusion by the fierceness and suddenness of
the attack. They still outnumbered their opponents,
but while they gathered together, and
were seeking to revenge their fallen comrades,
a discharge of fire-arms in their rear from Oriel
Porphyry, Zabra, Doctor Tourniquet, and the
professor, still more diminished their numbers,
and still more distracted their attention. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
were not allowed a moment of inaction. At
once from both sides came the attack. Pistols
were only discharged, when it was almost impossible
to miss; but the chief weapon was the
sword, and with this Hearty, Boggle, Climberkin,
and Ardent, well backed by their companions,
and Oriel Porphyry, closely followed by
Zabra, Fortyfolios, and the doctor, cut down all
who opposed them. The conflict was fierce.
Oriel Porphyry displayed an energy that nothing
could resist. He hewed his way through
the thickest of his foes, and they fell like reeds
before his sword; while a stern scorn was
breathing from his handsome features, and his
fine manly figure seemed to dilate with the
pride of conscious power. Close to his side
came Zabra, whose exertions were not so effective;
but his object seemed more to be to defend
Oriel than to attack the pirates. Several times
the arm that threatened the destruction of the
young merchant was rendered powerless by the
ready interference of his youthful friend, and
the pistol levelled at his head dropped harmless
to the ground. It soon became a struggle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
man to man. Each singled out his opponent,
and when he was disposed of, looked out for
another. In a few minutes the state of the parties
had changed exceedingly. A great number
of the pirates had fallen, and the rest, unable to
withstand the fierceness of the encounter, appeared
desirous of making their escape. They
were pressed so closely, that only three out of
the whole band got away, and each of these was
severely wounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my brave fellows, we have not a moment
to lose,&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel Porphyry.
&ldquo;Zabra, you will lead the way. Climberkin,
you are much hurt, I&rsquo;m afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s nothing, sir,&rdquo; replied the man cheerfully,
although he was bleeding from several
deep gashes: &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve nearly all got a few
scratches; but I wouldn&rsquo;t have cared being cut
to pieces, now I behold these blood-thirsty villains
so reg&rsquo;larly done for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we must get forward, or the others may
be upon us. Let every one look to his weapons,
and be in readiness to use them. You go on,
Zabra: I will follow you in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>The young merchant hastily re-entered the
house, while the others proceeded up the acclivity,
and before they reached the top, he
joined them. &ldquo;Hullo, my friends!&rdquo; he cried,
with a face glowing with excitement: &ldquo;just
take one parting glance at this den of infamy,
and I will stake my existence it will give you
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had scarcely turned round for the
purpose of complying with this request, when
they observed flames issuing from the windows
of the house. In so dry a climate fire burnt
rapidly, and very quickly the whole place was a
sheet of flame. While they were gazing, a loud
noise like an earthquake shook the ground upon
which they stood, and they beheld the house
lifted up high into the air&mdash;the walls crack&mdash;the
timbers split into pieces&mdash;and in a moment
the retreat of the pirates was a mass of smoking
ruins, and the air was darkened with a thick
smoke and a shower of ashes. The men gave
three hearty cheers, and proceeded merrily on
their way. They descended the mountain till
they came to the chasm where the rude bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
they had previously used remained. First,
Hearty got within the hoops, and with the assistance
of the ropes dragged himself across: when
the hoops were pulled back, each in succession
passed over; and the last was in the act of
crossing as the pirate chief and the rest of his
followers appeared upon the summit of the
mountain. A yell of mingled ferocity and hatred
arose as they witnessed the escape of their
prisoners; and with malignity in their eyes and
curses on their lips, they, as rapidly as possible,
commenced descending the rock with the intention
of overtaking the fugitives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut the ropes! cut the ropes!&rdquo; shouted
Oriel, and in an instant the swords of all the
party were hacking at the thick twists of hemp;
and as the pirates descended on the other side
they were severed, and the ends fell into the
abyss. A volley of pistol bullets and a chorus of
imprecations arose from the enraged and baffled
villains, but they did no mischief, and they
were only answered by a triumphant cheer from
the crew of the Albatross. The fugitives now
rapidly pursued their way till they came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
sea shore, where they found two boats high and
dry; these were immediately launched into the
sea, and pulling the oars vigorously, they were
soon by the side of the Albatross. There were
not above half a dozen of the pirates left in charge
of the ship, but these had noticed the approach
of the boats, and seeing who they contained,
were prepared to give them a hostile reception.
A gun was brought to bear upon them&mdash;they
saw it pointed&mdash;fired&mdash;and in the next moment
the shot whizzed over their heads. With another
cheer of triumph the brave fellows mounted
the ship&rsquo;s side. Every obstacle was used to prevent
their boarding, and the few who were in
the ship, from the determination with which
they defended it, seemed likely still to remain
its masters. At this instant, when Oriel and his
party were unavailingly attempting to make
good a footing upon the deck, assistance came
from a quarter from whence any thing so welcome
had never been anticipated.</p>

<p>Roly Poly was pursuing his avocations in the
cook-house when he heard the affray, and looking
out observed exactly the state of the opposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
parties. By him the pirates had never been
regarded with any thing like affection. They
had treated him with great disrespect. They
esteemed not his art, and spoke contemptuously
of his skill. His resolve was soon made, and as
quickly executed. Dipping a mop in a copper
of boiling water, in which his cookery was going
on, he hurried as fast as his fat limbs could
carry him upon deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See how Roly Poly come to &rsquo;sist him
friends,&rdquo; cried he, exultingly, as he began to use
his strange weapon among the pirates with a
dexterity that scattered them right and left.
&ldquo;Ha! you call my boofliful puddin&rsquo; &lsquo;choke dog&rsquo;&mdash;take
dat you libellious vagabone,&rdquo; and with a
forcible sweep the scalding mop descended upon
his face, sending him howling off his heels.
&ldquo;Ha! you say my lumptious soup wishy-washy,&mdash;take
dat, you ignrant jackmorass!&rdquo; and a resistless
blow upon the ear levelled him with his
companion, yelling with pain; and thus he proceeded
till he had cleared a way for Oriel Porphyry
and his coadjutors, who quickly silenced
all opposition. &ldquo;I hab you now, you fellar!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
shouted Roly Poly, striding in triumph over
one of his victims, and seemingly intent upon
ramming the scalding mop down the man&rsquo;s
throat. &ldquo;Like your imprence, I tink, you fellar!
to go for to say I boil sich nice puddin I make,
in nassy dishcloth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hubble, bubble, hubble, bloo!&rdquo; said the
choking wretch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I gib you puddin debblis nice, you
fellar!&rdquo; cried the fat cook, ramming away with
all his might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hobble, a bobble, a gobble, a gloo!&rdquo; were
the only sounds that were heard in reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dis nebber boil in nassy dishcloth, you
fellar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grow, a row, a row, ow, oo, oo, oo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like your &rsquo;bominable imprence, you fellar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rug, a rug, a glug.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take debblis good care you nebber say no
more sich diclus impossumbilties. Ha! him
dead as herrin&rsquo; now,&rdquo; observed the unrelenting
negro; and then adding, &ldquo;But serb him berry
right&mdash;berry right, indeed&mdash;a fellar!&rdquo; he
shouldered his mop, and turned on his heel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Up with the anchor, and get out to sea as
fast as you can,&rdquo; exclaimed Oriel Porphyry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I might advise, sir,&rdquo; said Hearty, respectfully,
&ldquo;I should recommend an unkimmon deal
o&rsquo; care in steerin through these shallows. I
paid &rsquo;ticular notice when we entered this here
rascally neighbourhood. I&rsquo;ve a notion them
varmint never had sich a reglar spiflification
since they commenced their murderin rigs&mdash;and
I&rsquo;m sartan sure the ship&rsquo;ll be lost if we
don&rsquo;t look out pretty sharpish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is best to be done?&rdquo; asked Oriel.
&ldquo;You, of all of us, are best acquainted with
these matters&mdash;what do you advise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why I advises this,&rdquo; replied the old man:
&ldquo;I thinks it&rsquo;s best, under all the &rsquo;cumstances o&rsquo;
the case, for a boat to be sent a little forrard
takin soundins, while I takes the helm and
pilots the ship &rsquo;cordingly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be done, then,&rdquo; said Master Porphyry;
&ldquo;and as I have the greatest confidence
in your skill and experience, and as I wish to
show in some appropriate manner how much I
regard the fidelity and courage you have evinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
in my service, from this time I intrust the
entire management of the ship to you, allowing
you to choose your own officers from among
those of your shipmates whom you think most
fitted for the duties you will require from
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this announcement a cheer of loud congratulation
proceeded from the delighted crew,
among whom Hearty, by the inoffensiveness of
his conduct, his general kindness, and approved
courage, had become remarkably popular; but
the old seaman appeared as if he did not know
what to make of so unexpected a piece of intelligence.
His honest, weather-beaten countenance
assumed a variety of different expressions,
and his confusion for some time prevented
his utterance. However, at last, making an
effort, he stammered, and as well as the state
of his feelings would allow,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank &rsquo;ee, sir. But though I desarves
nuffin o&rsquo; the sort, and ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hardly got gumption
enough for the sitivation, I&rsquo;ll do all as I can as
long as there&rsquo;s a timber afloat in this here craft,
or as long as ever I can be of any sarvice to the
owners.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Two men then went in a boat in advance of
the ship, taking soundings as they rowed along,
the result of which they continued to cry out to
Hearty, who with firm hand and steady eye
stood at the helm, skilfully piloting the ship
through the midst of the rocks. Notwithstanding
the caution that was used, she was
aground more than once; but immediately she
touched, she was backed off the rock by the
skilful seamanship of the anxious sailors; and in
this way she floated slowly along, threading the
intricacies of this dangerous navigation, till she
passed from amidst the breakers into the open
sea. It was an arduous task, and one full of
peril to the Albatross and her gallant crew;
and it was not without considerable anxiety that
Oriel Porphyry and his companions watched
the vessel&rsquo;s progress from the deck. They
spoke not to each other, but looked to the huge
masses of granite that rose around them&mdash;and
listened to the cry of the men in the boat with
an interest that had swallowed up every other
consideration. But when the ship was seen
safely clearing her way through the deep waters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
leaving the foaming breakers far in her rear,
each looked upon his neighbour as if congratulating
him on his escape; and Hearty, when he
gave the helm into the hands of Boggle, received
the sincere thanks of all whom by his skill he
had saved from destruction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zabra, you seem ill! What ails you?&rdquo; exclaimed
Oriel Porphyry, noticing for the first
time that the eyes of his young associate looked
dim and unsteady, and that he appeared as if
unable, from weakness, to keep his footing on
the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Oriel, nothing!&rdquo; replied Zabra,
faintly, as he caught hold of the arm of his
patron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried the merchant&rsquo;s son, in tones of
affectionate solicitude&mdash;&ldquo;you are wounded. I
see the blood trickling through your vest. How
strange I should not have observed it before,
and how wrong of you not to have mentioned
it. Doctor Tourniquet!&rdquo; cried he to the surgeon,
who was discussing with the professor
the philosophy of cause and effect, &ldquo;here is one
who requires your immediate attention. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
hope there is nothing of much consequence, but
whatever it may be, let it receive all your skill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Tourniquet hurried to his patient;
but not without evincing much concern in his
good-natured countenance, when he noticed by
whom he was wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, doctor, not now!&rdquo; cried Zabra,
hastily, and in evident confusion, as Tourniquet
was proceeding to examine the state of the
wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear young friend,&rdquo; observed the
surgeon, kindly, &ldquo;unless you let me take off
part of your dress it is impossible that I can
discover the injury you have received, don&rsquo;t
you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! I will remove his tunic,&rdquo; said Oriel,
eagerly coming forward to assist the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, no!&rdquo; hastily exclaimed Zabra,
retreating in alarm from the proffered assistance.
&ldquo;I shall be better presently&mdash;that is&mdash;I
am not much hurt. It is nothing. It will
get well without assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have your wound dressed, Zabra!&rdquo;
said Oriel Porphyry, surprised that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
young friend should exhibit such a disinclination
to intrust himself to the surgeon&rsquo;s
treatment. &ldquo;I dare say it will give you but
little pain, and will soon be over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can say nothing on the subject till I
have seen the wound, don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; remarked
the surgeon, in a slight degree offended at the
extraordinary want of confidence in his surgical
skill evinced by his patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very faint,&rdquo; cried Zabra, looking
bewildered around him, as he leaned for support
upon Master Porphyry&mdash;&ldquo;very faint. I
think I had better descend to my berth, where
the doctor can attend me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Oriel: &ldquo;only you must
let me assist you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no!&rdquo; exclaimed his young associate,
eagerly. &ldquo;Not now, Oriel. The doctor&rsquo;s arm
will be all the assistance I shall require. You
can come to me afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a strange creature,&rdquo; observed the
merchant&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;But let it be as you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Tourniquet assisted his patient into
a small cabin, into which he had scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
entered, before Zabra would have sunk on
the floor in a swoon, had not the surgeon
observed his faintness, and prevented him from
falling. He then laid him gently on his back.
The doctor never before had had such an
opportunity for noticing the rich and peculiar
beauty of the countenance before him. He
gazed for several minutes in undisguised admiration
on the faultless features of his youthful
patient, with the full conviction that he had
rarely, if ever, met with any human face so
attractive in its expression. The long black
curls which Zabra had allowed to grow till
they nearly reached his shoulder hung in
shining clusters around his face and forehead;
and the faint bronze in his complexion appeared
to heighten the grace in which the features
were modelled. Desirous of saving so much
attraction to the world, if it were endangered,
he sought to examine the injury the youth had
received. It was a gun-shot wound in the
shoulder. Doctor Tourniquet was carefully
unfastening and removing the upper part of his
patient&rsquo;s dress, for the purpose of getting at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
wound, when he suddenly started back, looking
as if in the highest degree bewildered and
amazed&mdash;his ruddy countenance acquired an
additional glow&mdash;and surprise seemed to have
had the power of taking away his breath; and
after some minutes&rsquo; silent wondering, with eyes
staring, and mouth opening wide, he recovered
sufficiently to be able to ejaculate a
long drawn &ldquo;whew!&rdquo;</p>
